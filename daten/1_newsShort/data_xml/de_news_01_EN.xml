<field name="text_en">The former SS Lieutenant Erich Priebke, who stands trial in Italy for WW II crimes, has been acquitted on all essential charges by a military court in Rome. The presiding judge, Mr. Quistelli, explained that the accusations against the 83-year-old Priebke are subject to the statute of limitations. The judge furthermore brought in extenuating circumstances. Priebke left the court as a free man. The prosecution had charged Priebke with multiple and particularly ferocious homicide. In the course of the trial, lasting three months, Priebke had admitted to have shot to death two people himself. He claimed, however, to have acted in an emergency situation, short of superior orders. The verdict was met with disagreement in the courtroom. Relatives of the SS victims called Priebke a fascist and a murderer.  </field>

<field name="text_en">The discussion around the envisaged major tax reform continues. The FDP economics expert, Graf Lambsdorff, today came out in favor of advancing the enactment of significant parts of the overhaul, currently planned for 1999. On Deutschlandfunk radio Lambsdorff explained that in view of the employment situation, a speedy reduction of the highest tax rates is necessary. Within the reform package, Lambsdorff considers an increase of the VAT [value added tax, sales tax] possible, in order to be able to cut income tax significantly. The head of the FDP parliamentary group, Mr. Solms, however, has deviated from the FDP's demand to enact the tax reform as early as 1998. The CDU/CSU has repeatedly insisted that the reform not become effective before 1999. Solms does not consider it feasible to implement the tax reform before the Bundestag elections in 1998. However, the FDP sticks to its three level model for taxation, according to which the highest tax rate of currently 50% will be cut to 35%. Since this would reduce the tax revenue by DM 120 billion, the Bavarian Finance Minister Erwin Huber considers the FDP's provision illusory. Huber (CSU) said that a division of labor, in which the FDP proclaims good deeds while the CDU/CSU has to take care of financing, is unacceptable. The SPD Federal Executive Manager, Mr. Muentefering, opposed the idea. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Muentefering demanded that all tax loopholes should be closed instead. The president of the Taxpayers' Association, Mr. Daeke, made a similar statement. On Deutschlandradio Berlin he called an increase of the VAT a punch in the face of the taxpayer.  </field>

<field name="text_en">The imminent gap of 2.2 billion DM in the state budget forces Baden-Wuerttemberg for the first time to make changes in the state's liabilities. Finance Minister Meyer-Vorfelder cautioned today that if measures are not taken quickly, one would have to slash investments. For the first time, services required by law are now up for discussion. Every minister already knows the amount that their department will have to do without. For example, 210 million DM in the Welfare Ministry. Here, the services required by law are the state child-care benefit, as well as subsidies to hospitals and child care centers. Which of the services are ultimately subject to be cut, will be decided by the government after the summer break in September.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt has called the discussion on a possible introduction of eco-taxes (ecological taxes) a "phantom debate". In the BILD tabloid, the FDP politician says eco-taxes could only be introduced EU-wide; otherwise only German businesses would be burdened, and thus German jobs be threatened.

<field name="text">Despite several attemps of leading CSU politicians to settle the dispute with CDU/CSU faction leader in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) Wolfgang Schaeuble, the CDU politicians has been attacked again by several CSU representatives. The Bavarian State Secretary of Economics, Mr Spitzner, said in the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper, Mr Schaeuble must have been totally out of mind. He [Mr Schaeuble] wanted to make the CSU a state party of the CDU. The Bavarian State Secretary of the Interior, Mr Sauter, said the Union [CDU/CSU] has in the person of Helmut Kohl a chancellor, and in Wolfgang Schaeuble a candidate [for chancellorship] - that was one [person] to many. Earlier, the CSU leadership had warned against a damaging leadership debate. Leader of the CSU faction in the Bavarian parliament Alois Glueck said he did no see any reason at all at the moment to speculate on the succession of Mr Kohl. If, however, one would ask this question now, Mr Schaeuble were his natural successor. Within the CSU there were no reservations against Mr Schaeuble.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the forecast of economic experts, the German job market will see a new record in the number of unemployed people this year. Despite the lasting export boom, the Nuremberg Institut fuer Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (Institute for job-market and career research) predicts an average of 4.46 million unemployed people for this year, up by 75.000 compared to last year. The institute that is affiliated with the Federal Labour Office based its calculation on a predicted economic growth of 2.75%. Other institutes as well as the Federal government predict a higher growth rate of the economy. In the course of the year the researchers [of the Nuremberg institute] expect a change in trend that, however, will not be a breakthrough [with respect to the job market]. All in all, Germany is short of some seven million jobs, according to the Nuremberg researchers.  </field>

<field name="text">In the opinion of CDU Secretary General Merkel, her party will succeed in shedding light on the party donations scandal even without the help of former Chancellor Kohl.  Ms. Merkel has accused Kohl of compounding the party's plight through his refusal to reveal the donors.  The Chancellor had put his word of honor above the law, Ms. Merkel added.  But democracy can only work if laws are adhered to, otherwise "we are progressing toward a state of anarchy," Ms. Merkel said.  With respect to the accounts in Lichtenstein and alleged bribes in connection with the sale of the chemical plant Leuna to Elf-Aquitaine, Ms. Merkel commented that she had no evidence of criminal acts by the former government.  </field>

<field name="text">Hesse's Minister President Koch can rely on his party's support.  At a meeting in Hofheim in the Taunus range, the state party delegates were solidly behind Koch.  Only yesterday it became known that several million marks are missing from the CDU's bank accounts abroad.  Kohl rejected the Opposition's demand to dissolve Parliament and to hold new elections. Koch: "The Parliament of Hesse must decide if it is capable to act.  The Parliament has the right to return its mandate to the voter only if it is no longer capable of fulfilling its duties.  And I emphasize for the government: The government is fully functional, there is no reason to suspend its work.  And we want to face the voter at a moment when we have had a chance to implement what we had promised before the elections.  By our work can then be judged if we have been capable."  </field>

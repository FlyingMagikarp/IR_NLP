<field name="text">Using the Coalition's parliamentary majority, the reform of legislation governing the transition from unemployment to the work force and unemployment benefit has finally been passed, despite the objections of the Bundesrat [The Upper House of Parliament, consisting of representatives of the States, currently under SPD majority].  The new law includes tougher rules as to what types of employment a person receiving unemployment assistance must accept.  Under the new regulations, after six months of unemployment people are required to accept jobs in which they would earn up to 30% less than they did previously.  Furthermore, they are obliged to accept any job offer, even if the qualifications it requires are less than the candidate's credentials.  The age limit for unemployment assistance is to be increased from 42 to 45 years.  There will be fewer federal subsidies for job-creation measures [ABM].  However, federal wage supplements for companies in the New States will be expanded. The majority of the new regulations will come into effect on April 1st; the remainder on January 1st 1998.  The opposition voted against the reform.  </field>

<field name="text">With an overwhelming majority, the Bundestag approved today ex post facto the Bundeswehr's evacuation mission in Tirana.  Last Friday, helicopters of the armed forces airlifted more than 100 foreigners, among them 21 Germans, out of Albania.  Defense Minister Ruehe and Foreign Minister Kinkel explained in Parliament that the mission had been imperative and had been justified on constitutional grounds.  The Federal Constitutional Court had granted the government the right to deploy troops abroad at its own discretion, in the event of immediate danger.  Speakers of the SPD declared that such a procedure should remain an exception.  They advocated, however, designing legal guidelines to involve the Bundestag in urgent foreign deployments of the Bundeswehr.  </field>

<field name="text">SPD parliamentary group leader Mr. Scharping's first reaction was that new negotiations are possible, but that Chancellor Kohl must first accept the offer of SPD chairman Mr. Lafontaine for talks.  In the opinion of the SPD deputy parliamentary group leader, Ms. Matthaeus-Maier, the SPD is willing to reopen the tax discussion with the Coalition.  As a precondition, however, Chancellor Kohl must signal clearly that the government wants an agreement, said Ms. Matthaeus-Maier on Deutschlandfunk radio.  She rejected the proposal of Finance Minister Waigel as useless, on the grounds that it would cause huge deficits.  She added that the SPD's foremost goal is a reduction of the employment overhead costs.  The Lower-Saxon Minister President Schroeder recommended that his party move toward the government's position on tax and energy.  Mr. Schroeder told the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that he doesn't care for tactical games.  </field>

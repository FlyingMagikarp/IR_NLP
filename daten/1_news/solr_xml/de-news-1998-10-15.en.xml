<field name="text">NATO signed an agreement with the Yugoslav army on aerial surveillance of Kosovo. The agreement is part of a settlement between US envoy Richard Holbrooke and President Slobodan Milosevic to resolve the crisis in Kosovo. NATO hopes in this way to bring about the arranged withdrawal of Yugoslav forces and the return of refugees. In Vienna, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe authorized the use of 2000 members of an OSCE mission to supervise compliance with the agreement on the ground. Parliament (Bundestag) will vote tomorrow on German participation in a possible NATO operation in Kosovo. A large majority in favor of participation is expected. In an internal vote, the SPD parliamentary group decided this evening to support participation.  </field>

<field name="text">A dispute is brewing between the Social Democrats and Alliance 90/Greens over the future size of the defense budget. The defense spokesperson for the Greens, Angelika Beer, objected to efforts by the SPD to fix the defense budget in the coalition contract. Ms. Beer told the newspaper Berliner Zeitung that her party's approval of the entire package could be endangered by this. Her SPD counterpart, Walter Kolbow responded that party leader Oskar Lafontaine and the future Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had assured Defense Minister designate Rudolf Scharping that the defense budget would be linked to the development of the gross domestic product.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the opinion of transportation experts from the SPD and the Greens, the high speed maglev rail line "Transrapid" will not be built. Hans Georg Wagner (SPD) and Albert Schmidt (Alliance 90/Greens) expressed the expectation that the federal government will drop out of the project because of an expected explosion in construction costs. As the Transrapid-Planning Corp. confirmed in Schwerin, the Federal Railways Administration expects additional costs of up to 2.8 billion DM for the construction of the rail lines alone. Additional expenses for the drive-motor system are apparently also expected. The German Railway (Deutsche Bahn) declared yesterday it would still be willing to be the administrator, but would not take on any additional expenses.  </field>

<field name="text">After the moderate wage agreements of the last few years, labor unions want to secure higher wages on a broad front in the collective bargaining for 1999. According to the newspaper Bild Zeitung, the unions for the public service and transportation sector (OeTV), trade, bank, and insurance industry (HBV), and salaried employees (DAG) supported the demand of the metal, engineering, and electronics union (IG- Metall) for a 6.5% increase. Herbert Mai, head of the OeTV, did not want to commit to a specific number. According to Suedwestrundfunk radio, Dieter Hundt, president of the employers' association, warned the unions against aligning themselves with IG-Metall's course. He said that excessive increases could trigger an increase in unemployment.  </field>

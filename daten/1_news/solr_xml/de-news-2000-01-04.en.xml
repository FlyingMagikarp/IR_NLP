<field name="text">The German Institute for Economics Research predicts that the economic growth will be 2.4 percent this year. However, they also expect that the number of unemployed in December last year has passed the four-million mark again. Although this does not look rosy at first view, the experts are relieved. The number of unemployed people may have risen by 150'000 to 200'000 but this would be less than the quarter million recorded the previous year. A positive sign, the experts purportedly agree. The lower numbers are probably due to a mild December weather and economic growth that is slowly gaining speed.  </field>

<field name="text">Information about the transfer of millions of marks from the CDU parliamentary faction and the party are still quite confusing. It is clear that the CDU Bundestag faction has given about 1.15 million marks to the party - in cash. It is not clear where the money comes from. Today, Joachim Hoerster, executive officer of the parliamentary faction, was unable to explain the origin in detail. He considered the million-mark transfer from faction to party unusual but not inexplicable and in no way illegal. The money that was handed over in a suitcase belonged to the party. Since an account number could not be used, the money was paid cash. Beyond that, he was not concerned with where the money ended up. At any rate, faction leader Wolfgang Schaeuble was not informed about the details, said Hoerster. Gunda Roestel, spokeswoman for the Buendnis90/Gruene executive, called again on the CDU to resolve the confusion quickly. After all, lawyer Schaeuble must know that the parliamentary faction of a large mainstream party is neither the Olsen gang [a comic, hapless Danish gang from a series of movies] nor a bowling club.  </field>

<field name="text">A Bundeswehr (German Army) passenger airplane with 24 people on board has probably crashed near the African coast. According to the Minister of Defense, the plane, a Russian "Tupolev 154", has been missing since yesterday afternoon which was when the last radio transmission was received.  It has most probably crashed into the sea about 1500 kilometers west of Angola. There were ten crew members on board, twelve other soldiers and two wives. The soldiers were on their way to participate in a sailing regatta for the 75th anniversary of the South African marine corps. According to Minister Ruehe, there is no hope that the soldiers are alive.  The airplane was flying from Cologne/Bonn to Cape Town. Minister Ruehe said that the plane had not transmitted any distress signals, so the reason and the exact location of the crash is not as yet known. First search efforts have not found anything. A team of Bundeswehr experts left for South Africa in the evening. Other countries have offered their help. There are indications that the plane might have collided with another airplane. According to unconfirmed reports, an airplane of the US airforce which was in the same area at the same time is missing as well and American satellites have taken a picture of a bright flash of light in the South Atlantic.  </field>

<field name="text">Politicians of all the major parties support a move to suspend drivers' licenses for small offenses instead of imposing fines. Mr. Eylmann of the CDU, who is the chairman of the Bundestag legal committee, said in an interview with the weekly paper "Bild am Sonntag" that most people would perceive the loss of mobility as punishment. Losing driving privileges is therefore more effective than a fine or a term of short imprisonment. Mr. Simm (sp?), a Member of Parliament for the SPD, said that suspending drivers' licenses has the advantage of affecting rich and poor people equally. Legal experts from the CDU, FDP and the Green Party as well as the Association of Judges have also welcomed the idea.  </field>

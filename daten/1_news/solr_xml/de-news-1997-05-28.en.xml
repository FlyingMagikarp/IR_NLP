<field name="text">The divide between the ruling coalition and the SPD on the tax reform question has widened again. Bohl, a Secretary of the Chancellor's Office for the CDU, said after a telephone conversation with the secretary-general of the SPD, that the Opposition seemed to have no interest in further talks on the issue. Bohl's greatest criticism of the SPD was that they were not prepared to present their own plan for the tax reform as a parliamentary Bill for debate in the Bundestag. He said that the government would still meet the SPD for expert talks, however. The government hopes to have the reform passed by the Bundestag before the summer break.  </field>

<field name="text">Employers representatives, the unions and employment minister Blum, have still not succeeded in working out a common position on the planned pension reform, but, according to the Ministry for Employment, all parties involved intend to continue the talks on the issue. The greatest sticking point is the fact that the government plans to lower pension rates, but there is general agreement that the current system of financing pensions through contributions should remain.  </field>

<field name="text">A Remembrance service has been held for the two German soldiers who recently died in Bosnia. The soldiers, who belonged to Jaegerbataillon 292 which is stationed in Donauschingen, were killed by rounds fired from a scout tank. Most of those present at the service were soldiers. Klaus Ruse, secretary of state in the Ministry of Defence, said in a speech at the service that everyone had been shocked by the terrible accident. Later in the week, the two soldiers are to be buried with full military honours in their home towns of Freiburg in Baden-Wuerttenberg and Guestrow (sp?) in Neubrandenburg. The two, members of the German contingent of SFOR in Bosnia, died last Friday. They were checking over their vehicles when the tank's cannon went off accidentally, firing several rounds which penetrated into the interior of the tank in which they and one other soldier were sitting. The two who were badly injured, a sergeant and a lance corporal, died shortly after the accident. The third soldier, who was also injured, is now being treated in the army hospital in Ulm.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bundesbank's central banking committee is to discuss today the government's plan to revalue Germany's reserves of gold and foreign currencies. Finance Minister Waigel has sent the Bundesbank a paper with benchmark figures for the revaluation. According to a report in the Boersenzeitung (a financial newspaper) Waigel plans to achieve a distribution of over DM 10 billion through the move. The newspaper also reports that Tietmayer (sp?), the president of the Bundesbank, has advised against the revaluation. The Bundesbank's gold reserves are valued at the lowest level, in accordance with the law. A revaluation to the current market price could bring in a profit on paper of up to DM 40 billion.  </field>

<field name="text">Post Minister Boetsch has decided that the Deutsche Telekom telecommunications company will have to allow its competitors to use its telephone network in future, including its connections in the home. He said that Telekom will not be allowed to abuse its position as the market leader, but will have to make its connections available to other companies. He continued, saying that Telekom had reckoned with this decision and has already made offers along these lines to possible competitors. The Post Ministry also warned Telekom against setting the price for the use of its network too high; if there should be any disagreement about the price again, Boetsch said, then his ministry would give a quick and precise response to the question. Telekom also announced today that it does not want the government to sell its shares in the company on the stock exchange. There was no way that the company would agree to a further sale of shares in this way.  </field>

<field name="text">The Daimler Benz company is expecting more than 8,000 shareholders to attend its Annual General Meeting. Last year, Schremp, the chairman of the board, had to account for a loss of DM 5.7 billion, but this year the company will be paying dividends again based on present figures and the trend in the current year. Between January and April 1997, the company's turnover increased by 15 per cent to DM 96.3 billion. Sales increased most in the other countries of western Europe and in the USA. The profits are also reflected in the numbers employed by the company: 289,000 people are employed by Daimler Benz world-wide, an increase of one per cent over last year. These positive developments have also made jobs at the company in Germany safer.  </field>

<field name="text">Steffi Graf has won her second round match in the French Open. Even though she won 6:3 and 6:3 in 55 minutes, her performance was not particularly convincing. Graf, who has won the French Open five times was struggling to beat her French opponent who was ten years younger than her. Graf's game was not nearly as impressive as that which she played yesterday against the Argentinean Paola Suarez, which lasted 54 minutes and in which she only lost five games. Today Graf took one minute longer and lost one more game. She will meet either Naoko Kitchimuta (sp?) from Japan or Marie Serna form Spain in the third round.  </field>

<field name="text">The accused kidnapper and murderer of Frankfurt businessman Fiszmann was apparently involved in two other kidnappings as well. According to the public prosecutors in Frankfurt and Cologne, there are indications that Korpen, who is presently under arrest, held Fiszmann's nephew captive for several days in 1991, and the son of an Offenbach businessman in 1993. In searching Korpen's former home, police claim to have found evidence that Fiszmann's nephew, who was then six years old, had been hidden there. There is also supposed to be evidence in the 1993 case, in which a ransom of 2 million marks was paid, pointing at Korpen. Korpen and his son have been in police custody since the middle of October.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal cabinet has agreed upon another bill to bring about the third stage in health reform. Its goal is to change the regulations governing state health insurance, as well as to stabilize contribution premiums. Federal Health Minister Seehofer said that the reforms would ensure that only medically necessary and socially essential services would be financed through contributions. Thus, travel costs, health spas, and home care would no longer be covered. People requiring dentures will receive fixed-amount lump-sum payments from their insurance company, but will settle the dental bill privately. As well, everyone with state health insurance will have to make a special payment of 20 marks within the next 3 years toward hospital maintenance. The state insurance companies will be able to offer or restrict services beyond the catalogued minimum. Social Minister Blum objects to the exclusion of home care from coverage, fearing additional burdens on nursing care insurance. The introduction of elements of private health insurance, such as the right to switch insurance companies, is not likely to take place, as had been discussed, with the bill. The SPD and the Greens criticized the bill as a burden for the chronically ill, and as dismantling an intact health care system. The Bundestag begins debating the bill next week.  </field>

<field name="text">According to Employment Minister Blum, the federal government is not planning to touch nursing care insurance in order to keep pension payments down. In a special sitting called by the SPD, Blum told the Bundestag that the state nursing care insurance system would close 1996 with a surplus of 8.7 billion marks - which it needed. He also indicated that pension contributions would have to be increased in 1997, but the exact amount was left open. The FDP confirmed that the coalition had been considering delaying the transfer of contributions for pensioners' nursing care insurance from pension coffers in order to keep pension contributions under 20 percent in the coming year. The vice-chairman of the SPD, Dressler, said that the SPD had foiled a new attempt by the coalition to manipulate the social security system.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal cabinet today approved the "Old Vehicle Ordinance". It requires the auto industry to take back unwanted old cars, as long as they are no more than 12 years old. The ordinance complements a declaration of self-regulation by the industry. Vehicles registered before the law's coming into force will be excepted. Owners who do not dispose of their old vehicles in a manner consistent with the ordinance face a fine of up to 100,000 marks. The cabinet also approved the introduction of the new European driver's license in the middle of next year. The credit card-sized license is supposed to be harder to counterfeit than the old one. Drivers will not be required to trade in their old license for a new one. The cabinet agreed to give traffic violators a break, as well. In the future it will be possible to work off demerit points by taking lessons in safe driving. In addition, a bill to rewrite the rules governing product packaging was approved; the new rules will improve conditions for the use of re-usable containers for drinks.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the FDP, the governing federal coalition was close to breaking up over the dispute about taxes and the solidarity supplement. Party leader Solms said the alliance was seriously jeopardized, and both sides were considering their options. Then, a talk with the Chancellor had the effect of a cleansing storm, Solms said; an agreement to wait until the middle of December to decide whether and how much to lower the solidarity supplement has ended discussions on alternatives to the coalition.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Research Minister Ruttgers has called upon the food industry to label genetically manipulated foodstuffs voluntarily. In an interview with the New Osnabruck Paper, Ruttgers said that otherwise there would soon be a sticker for food not changed through genetic technology - because people wanted to know what was in their food. Soya beans thought to have been genetically manipulated were introduced to Germany for the first time yesterday through Hamburg harbour. Greenpeace protested the importation of the soya beans. Environment and consumer protection groups fear health risks from genetically altered foodstuffs.  </field>

<field name="text">The president of the Bavarian senate, Schmitt-Glaser, has unexpectedly announced his resignation. He said he would step down on 27 November. The move was obviously in response to all-party criticism of remarks he made about the Landtag. Earlier this morning the 63-year-old rejected the idea of resigning. Schmitt-Glaser, in a speech, had questioned the effectiveness of the Landtag and reproached its deputies for "lacking expertise".  </field>

<field name="text">According to the directors of the SDR and SWF radio institutions, a fusion of the two - and hence the founding of a new two-state institution in the south-west - is essential. Both made it clear to the survey commission looking into reforming the German radio system that simple cooperation in programming would no longer be sufficient. They said that a two-state institution in the south-west would allow state-specific programmes to be improved. SDR director Funfgeld called on the politicians to solve the problem of where the future broadcaster should locate its stations and headquarters quickly.  </field></doc></add>

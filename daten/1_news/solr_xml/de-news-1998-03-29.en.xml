<field name="text">The Federal Ministry of Labor has dismissed criticism by the Tax Payer's League of building plans for the new Ministry of Labor in Berlin. A spokesman said that the Ministry had not made any special demands. He also quoted the Federal Minister of Labor, Norbert Bluem, who had apparently said that he would work in any office, regardless of how it is equipped. Mr. Lau, the Vice President of the Tax Payer's League had criticized that the building where the former Propaganda Ministry of the Third Reich had been housed, was receiving a luxurious renovation including stone and marble floors costing 127 million marks. Bonn reacted by saying that the renovation would probably cost 40 million marks less than originally estimated and that no final decision had as yet been made about the building.  </field>

<field name="text">Leading representatives of employers in trade and industry have criticized industry's proposals to hold talks with the SPD. According to Mr. Philipp, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, there is no particular need at this point of time for industry to hold special discussions with the SPD. Even Mr. Fuchs, the president of the Federal Association of German Wholesale and Export Trade, has distanced himself from the proposed talks. He said "I don't think much of rushed compliance". Both the  Federation of German Industry and the Council of German Chambers of Commerce had recently proposed to talk to the SPD about the Social Democrats' election program.  </field>

<field name="text">Thomas Drach, the man assumed to be the leader of the group who kidnapped the German industrialist Philipp Reemtsma about two years ago, has apparently been captured. Both the "Bild" newspaper and the official Argentinean press agency have reported that the 37-year-old Drach, for whom the police have issued an international arrest warrant, was arrested yesterday evening in a luxury hotel in Buenos Aires. German investigators had traced him to Buenos Aires where he was going to attend a concert of the Rolling Stones. The German Federal Office for Criminal Investigation have confirmed that a German in Argentina has been arrested, but that his identity is currently being investigated. Investigators have established that Drach had organized the kidnapping of the Hamburg multimillionaire in March 1996 and held him captive for 33 days. Reemtsma was released after a ransom of 30 million marks had been paid. Drach's accomplices were arrested in Spain only a few weeks after the kidnapping and have already been sentenced to long jail sentences.  </field>

<field name="text">Berlin. Today in Berlin, the 55th anniversary of the failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler on July 20th, 1944, is being commemorated. The Mayor of Berlin said that the attempt had not been in vain despite its failure. At the government's official celebration ceremony, Minister of  Defense Scharping  emphasized that the resistance had led directly to the creation of the Federal Republic. The President of the German Parliament Rau laid a wreath to commemorate the victims of National-Socialism.  On the evening in question 430 armed forces recruits took a public vow at the German resistance memorial in Bendler-Block. That was where Hitler's attempted assassins led by Colonel Graf Stauffenberg were executed after the attempt failed. In his speech Chancellor Schroeder said that the armed forces were a peace force committed to protecting Human Rights. The war in Kosovo proved this. In spite of extreme security precautions, a number of demonstrators succeeded in disturbing the public vow. With slogans written on umbrellas, they demanded the disbandment of the armed forces. Approximately ten protesters, numbering at least two half-naked women, approached the recruits who were preparing for the ceremony. The protesters were led away by the police. Defence minister Scharping said on national television that the protests had almost ended in a more comical fashion. It is something for people to smile about.  </field>

<field name="text">The Minister of Economics Mueller has received support after presenting his first economic report. The business associations demanded the report be used as a guide line for the government. The trade unions criticized the report however, since it places the responsibility for economy and employment exclusively on the trade unions. In his report Mueller calls on businesses and citizens to lower their claims on the state. That being crucial to ensure long-term growth and employment. Mueller demands that the unions and management align their wage agreements with the improvement of productivity in order to contribute to the decrease of unemployment. For the present year Mueller counts on a economic growth of just under two percent. Mueller says he is hoping for a small economic revival and counts on a growth of 2.5 percent or somewhat more the coming year.  </field>

<field name="text">The meeting of the Knights' Cross bearers scheduled to be held in Dresden today, has been canceled by the War Veterans Association itself. In official statement, the Association announced that they wanted to avoid any controversies. Only yesterday, the Knights' Cross bearers had received permission to hold their meeting, through a court ruling. Immediately following the ruling, human rights groups and parties had announced plans to stage protests against the Knights' Cross bearers' meeting. When informed about these developments, the Bundeswehr canceled its participation in the meeting. The Bundeswehr had originally planned to stand guard of honor at the Dresden cemetery "Nordfriedhof." The Knights' Cross award had been instituted in 1939 by the Nazi Regime, as a new category of the Iron Cross. Adolf Hitler himself had selected each recipient of the honor.  </field>

Twenty-one car models are being introduced to the German public for the first time. Visitors have nine more days to check out the 250 exhibitors' booths. Federal minister of the economy, Rexrodt, stressed in his speech at the opening ceremony that the German automobile industry supported the current economic upswing, with growth rates of seven to eight per cent. Rexrodt also voiced his reservations about a rise in gasoline prices to five marks per liter. He explained that such a step was not going to help solve any current problems. Rexrodt elaborated that what was needed were incentives for the prevention of environmental strain. One of them could be car taxation according to emissions quality.  </field>

<field name="text">The vice chair of the CDU/CSU parliamentary fraction, Geissler, has called for an increase in VAT by at least one percentage point. In an interview with the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag," he explained that in order to solve the most pressing budgetary problems, postponing the reduction in solidarity tax was not going to be sufficient. Geissler believed that drastic changes in financial politics were necessary, which would also have a positive impact on the job market. The increase in VAT could be used to finance services not covered by insurance, and thus to reduce employers' expenses, said Geissler.  </field>

<field name="text">Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber has sharply criticized of the tax politics promoted by the liberal parties. In a newspaper interview, Stoiber said that the plans for an early reduction of the solidarity tax had been forced upon the government by the FDP, and had never been supported by his party. He accused the FPD of constantly calling for reductions in state revenue and of trying to finance these cuts exclusively by reducing the social budget. Stoiber believed that waiting times for unemployment pay were damaging to the socialist foundation of the republic. Yesterday, the governing coalition had resolved not to lower the solidarity tax to 6.5 per cent in 1997. Only in 1998, the tax will be reduced to 5.5 per cent of the current income tax rate.  In an interview with the radio station "Deutschlandfunk," FDP Secretary General Westerwelle had announced today that after yesterday's compromise reached by the coalition, tax discussions were closed for the current legislature period. Westerwelle added that in case of further gaps in the federal budget, there would have to be budget cuts, rather than increased costs for the citizens.  </field>

<field name="text">During its party conference, which opened today in Lauchhammer, the PDS in Brandenburg is discussing the fate of the township of Hornow, which is threatened by open-cast mining. The PDS state party board proposes that the township, located in Sorbian (sp?) territory, is to be opened to open-cast mining only if the economic and environmental necessity of such a step can be proved. Opinions within the party are split as to whether the party should support the township's struggle against the mining or the jobs that would be created by the mining operations. The inhabitants have been fighting to keep their community for a long time. On the other hand, more than 1,500 miners had demonstrated to keep their jobs at the last PDS party conference.  </field>

<field name="text">During the last year, profits of businesses have grown at a much faster rate than employees' salaries, reports the German Federation of Unions (DGB), quoting from data collected by the federal office for statistics. These numbers indicate that brut profit for companies in 1995 rose fifteen per cent on average while net profits rose by even twenty-one per cent, as compared to the previous year. In contrast, the income of employees grew by only 3.6 per cent brut, and by 0.6 per cent net. DGB board member Geuenich considered these numbers to be in stark contrast with the employers' claim that salaries were too high. Geuenich added that in this context, there was no reasonable explanation for the government's continuation to grant tax breaks to businesses.  </field>

<field name="text">The financial politics speaker of the parliamentary fraction of Buendnis 90/The Greens, Scheel, has admonished the SPD not to waste their chance for a change in governmental leadership in 1998 over another fight about whom to nominate, as they did last time. In an interview with the radio station "Sender Freies Berlin," Scheel said that the financial and tax politics of the government had united the opposition. As an example she listed that representatives of both fractions had reacted to the governmental decision to postpone the reduction in solidarity tax with a joint press conference. This was the fist time such a thing had happened, Scheel said. She added that she hoped that the SPD would put its energy into achieving a change in power in its preparations for the 1998 electoral campaign, rather than preoccupying itself with inner-party struggles.  </field>

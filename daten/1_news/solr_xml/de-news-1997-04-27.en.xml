<field name="text">According to several SPD state premiers, it should be possible to reach an agreement on the planned tax reforms by the end of this year. Gerhard Schroeder (SPD), the state premier for Lower Saxony, said that it was not too late for tax reforms. Independent of party, the important factors for the state premiers to discuss in the Bundesrat (upper house of parliament) and conferring committees would be how much strain could be placed on the budgets. The SPD leader of the Rheinland Palatinate, Kurt Beck, and the mayor of Hamburg, Henning Voscherau, were also optimistic that a compromise could be reached.  </field>

<field name="text">Oskar Lafontaine, the national leader of the SPD, has reiterated that the Social Democrats will not make concessions to the ruling governing coalition regarding tax reforms. Mr. Lafontaine stressed in a letter to SPD officials that the SPD were against an increase in value added tax to compensate for tax cuts for top earners. He also said that the SPD would not support increasing mineral oil tax or value added tax to counterbalance the Kohl government's budget deficits. Furthermore he said that Chancellor Kohl knows full well that his promised tax cuts are not affordable, and that the coalition's proposals would not decrease unemployment by the next election. These were the reasons why the Chancellor had deliberately brought an end to the tax reform talks with the SPD.  </field>

<field name="text">Jagoda, the president of the Federal Labour Office, has said that further cuts in weekly working hours could be an instrument in constraining growing joblessness. He said to the Deutschlandfunk radio station that this would not solve the problem for all, but that a reduction in working hours could alleviate the situation. The head of the Federal Labour Office in Nuremberg also called for speedy decisions to be made regarding tax reforms, adding that stalemates lasting months did not lead to any positive impulses. Mr. Jagoda also said that he is of the opinion that the job market would pick up as soon as this year, however the yearly unemployment average would still be over 4 million. He also contradicted the prevailing negative opinion of Germany's status as a location for industry. Mr. Jagoda said that the German people were willing to work hard, interest rates were low and that the currency was stable. It was no new development that workers were paid comparatively high wages when compared internationally.  </field>

<field name="text">Dieter Schulte, the president of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB) has warned against political stagnation in Germany. He said in an interview with the German press agency that the failed tax reform talks between the government and the Social Democrats were proof of the political shortcomings. The main political parties had passed up their chance to show their ability for reform partywide. Mr. Schulte warned against the long-term political consequences of this. When there is an unemployment rate of practically five million, he said, one cannot allow oneself to fall into a political vacuum until the national elections in 1998. This would be a catastrophe. Furthermore, Mr. Schulte said that with goodwill on both sides it should have been possible to lower indirect wage costs in the near future. Compromises were possible in practically all points of conflict.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Union of Employees (DAG) has warned against a breakdown of social order in the Federal Republic. This would put political stability at stake, according to the Union's May Appeal published today. Germany must not allow itself to be relegated socially to the status of a developing country. The fight against unemployment will only succeed, if the government, employers and union leaders assign utmost priority to this goal. Within this context, the DAG has called for further cuts in working hours in order to be able to create new jobs. Should this proposal be accepted, they would not insist on full compensation of the difference in pay.  </field>

<field name="text"> The Federal Minister for Health, Horst Seehofer, wants fewer advertisements for alcoholic drinks to be shown during sport programmes on television. In an interview he said that in view of the two and a half million alcoholics in Germany he considered that the present number of alcohol-related advertisements, particularly during sports broadcasts, was irresponsible. Moreover, it gave the definite impression that sport and alcohol belong together. Mr. Seehofer hopes to persuade the directors of both public and private television stations to introduce voluntary restrictions at certain times of the day and during certain programmes. Mr. Seehofer said that he was not seeking an outright ban on the advertising of alcohol; it was rather the scale of the advertisements which concerned him.  </field>

<field name="text">This weekend the small Basque town of Guernica remembered the bombing by German fighters sixty years ago. In a statement read out at the commemoration ceremony on Saturday morning, President Herzog addressed the descendants of the victims. He said "I want to take full responsibility for the past and expressly acknowledge the blame of the German aircraft involved." On April 26th 1937 the German Condor legion bombed Guernica, destroying three-quarters of the town. Up to 1700 people were killed. The air strike against the strategically unimportant town served to demonstrate the Nazi's support for the future dictator, General Franco, and also tested the strength of the Luftwaffe.  </field>

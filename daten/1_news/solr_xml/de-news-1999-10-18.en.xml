<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder once again ruled out changes to the reorganization of the 630 DM jobs. However, Schroeder said at the annual meeting of the National Association of German Newspaper Publishers in Berlin he would welcome talks about reducing bureaucracy for the adoption of the law.  The chancellor admitted that the government's measures had gone too far with respect to the amendment on fictitious self-employment. The proposed change intends to exempt new business owners from paying social insurance contributions for a certain period of time. The same applies to older persons who had already gained entitlement.  The vice-president of the newspaper publishers, Heinen, criticized the laws as doing away with jobs and being counterproductive.  </field>

So far, the forum had voiced the demands of the East German population insufficiently.  The people did no longer trust the SPD in East Germany to take their needs into consideration.  For this reason, the Forum would more strongly voice questions such as matching salaries between East and West.  </field>

<field name="text">A resolution about the alleged intolerance of the German federal government towards minorities, hence also towards Scientology, failed on Sunday night in the US House of Representatives. 318 representatives voted against the assertion that members of Scientology were persecuted because of their religious beliefs and discriminated in Germany; 101 representatives voted for it. The Congress committee for international relations had drawn up a resolution one week ago, asking President Bill Clinton to file a protest with the German government about the alleged discrimination of members of the sect. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and other German politicians had harshly criticized this draft. During Kinkel's visit to Washington last week, he addressed the draft at several meetings with members of the Clinton government, and officially protested the reproaches. At his departure last Wednesday night, he had received indications that the resolution would not gain majority in the House of Representatives. This has been confirmed in last night's vote.  </field>

<field name="text">The chances to find a compromise in the dispute about the reform of the pension system have decreased again. CDU and FDP declared themselves in favour of commencing the reforms in 1998 instead of 1999. Chairman of the SPD, Oskar Lafontaine said that pension cutbacks would not be approved by his party. At the same time, he offered the coalition to increase excise to allow for a decrease in pension insurance contributions. Lafontaine also asked the federal government to free the pension system of "outside benefits" such as pensions for eastern European immigrants of German ancestry. CSU Chairman and Federal Finance Minister, Theo Waigel said that a VAT-increase in 1998 is unlikely, and also rejected a higher tax on oil.  </field>

<field name="text">Hamburg's SPD cleared the way for the first red-green coalition in the Hanseatic city. At a state party conference, the coalition agreement with the Green-Alternative Party (GAL) was carried unanimously. The delegates also accepted the proposals for the 8 posts for the Senate which they are to provide. According to the proposal, Berlin's current Justice Minister Lore Maria Peschel-Gutzeit is to take over the same post in Hamburg. Secretary of State Nuehman-Seidebinkel is to replace the designated First Mayor Ortwin Runde as finance senator. The former minister for urban development, Thomas Mirow, will be senator of economics. The remaining SPD-lead departments remain unchanged. The GAL had approved the coalition contract with a two-thirds majority at a general meeting on Sunday night. The new Senate has to be approved by the State Parliament on Wednesday.  </field>

<field name="text">Army Priest Oberhern said that in the opinion of catholic priests in the armed forces, actions of the federal army outside of Germany change the consciousness of the soldiers. Not only would an emergency case change the consciousness of soldiers, but it would also attract right-wing-oriented persons liable for military service. The Federal Ministry of Defence rejected this opinion, stating that army clergymen in foreign actions in particular knew that appearance and actions of soldiers promoted the image of the Federal Army and of Germany. The ministry pointed to Bosnia- Herzegovina as an example.  </field>

<field name="text">The negotiations for a compensation of forced labourers in Nazi-Germany have come to an agreement, says the Jewish World Congress. The JWC stated further that US Foreign Minister Madelaine Albright and US negotiator Stuart Eizenstat will fly to Germany to sign the treaty. Apparently, the German government has guaranteed that the German contribution to compensate the forced labourers will be raised from eight to ten million marks. One half of the amount will be covered by the German government, the other half by a group of German companies. At the traditional fall meeting of State Premiers on Thursday, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will try to get the federal states to contribute to the government share.  </field>

<field name="text">At the close of the Social-Democrat's (SPD) federal party conference a large majority of the delegates passed State Premier Gerhard Schroeder's program on economic policy.   Schroeder demands less governmental regulation, more support for young entrepreneurs, promotion of medium-sized firms and of the white-collar sector. Schroeder said, the Social Democrats do have the right ideas, yet keep discussing them for too long. The party's youth organisation Jusos (Young Socialists) regard the program as too vague. Juso chairwoman Andrea Nahles called on Schroeder to clearly indicate how many jobs can be created with this new program.  </field>

<field name="text">Governing coalition and employers heavily criticized the Social Democrat's new economic policy. The Christian Democrat's parliamentary party leader said the Social Democrats would revive antiquated clichis. Federal party secretary-general Guido Westerwelle called the SPD an old aunt who relies solely on the state. President of the employers' association Hundt felt sorry that Schroeder's paper, which was correct to a considerable degree, had been watered down at the party conference in Hannover. The Council of German Chambers of Commerce considered Schroeder's paper as an agreeable turning away from class struggle slogans.  </field>

<field name="text">100,000 students are protesting all over Germany against the present education policy and tuition fees. In Mainz about 7,000 students marched to the Ministry of Education. Minister of Education and Science Zoellner said the state's efforts could not be increased any more - students in turn reproached him for being hypocritical. Demonstrations also in other state capitals: in Wiesbaden, Berlin, Hannover, Saarbruecken and Kiel, but also in Bonn, Karlsruhe, Freiburg and Tuebingen. The largest rally took place in Duesseldorf. 40,000 students came from all over North Rhine-Westphalia. Banners said "Seminarleiter statt Eurofighter" (lecturers instead of Eurofighter). In the meantime it became known that the states want to agree on the issue of federal education/training assistance (BAfoeG): the heads of the State Premier's Offices and Ministers of Finance want to search for a cost-neutral reform. The model proposed by the Ministers of Education and Science -- the uniform education assistance, is off the table.  </field>

<field name="text">The United States announced a second international conference on compensations for victims of the Holocaust. With this resolution the London conference ended. About 40 countries discussed about how to improve compensation for victims. US deputy secretary of state Steward Eisenstead called on the involved countries to contribute to the international aid fund. On Tuesday the United States and the UK established this fund, by now only six countries declared to contribute. The remaining 5 and a half tons gold from the former Nazi stock shall be quickly distributed through the trilateral Gold Commission. Representatives of the Jewish World Congress were disappointed by the outcome of the three-days conference. The Vatican would have kept silent about the gold worth DM three million, which used to belong to 28,000 Gypsies. Those Gypsies had been killed in Croatia by the fascist Ustascha regime.  </field>

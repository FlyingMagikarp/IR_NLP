<field name="text">This morning coalition parties and the SPD presented a common strategy for the so-called Big Bug Attack, and the Minister of Justice liked very much what he saw. This is intended to fight organised crime. Mr Schily, of the SPD, said that the compromise made sense. The bugging dwellings would be subject to strict controls by the courts and parliament. He also welcomed the much enhanced possibilities to seize assets acquired through proceeds from criminal activities. Minister Kanther stated that he expected the draft to be passed into law shortly, and also thought that the law would have no problem getting the required majority for a change of the constitution.   </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Pension System for Employees (BfA) appealed to government and the opposition SPD to come to the party and agree on the reform of the pensions. In an interview with a newspaper, director Michaelis said that 18 million pensioners and 35 million employees were entitled to a compromise in such an important matter, across floors and parties. First of all, the federal subsidy would have to be raised by 15 billion marks, as quickly as possible, so the Pension System would get into the black again.   </field>

<field name="text">The approx. 760,000 federal public servants are to be more in control of their working-hours, in the future, though there is no question of them getting more spare time. Minister for Internal Affairs Kanther refuted a claim by tabloid BILD that public servants' working-hours are to be lowered, whereas their breaks (morning-tea, lunch and afternoon-tea?) were to be extended. The goal of the planned reform was to add flexibility to the public service. In the future they should be able to take some hours or days off 'in lieu' (instead of getting paid for over-time). Mr Kanther confirmed that federal public servants already had Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve off, but had lost two other holidays to make up for it. They will keep working 38.5 hours/week.  </field>

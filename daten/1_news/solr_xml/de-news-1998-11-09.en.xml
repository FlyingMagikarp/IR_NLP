<field name="text">For the first time, Federal Minister for the Environment, Trittin, had good news for Germany's drivers. There is no doubt that the tax on gasoline will increase by 6 Pfennig per liter as planned. He rejected demands from within his own party for a higher increase in gasoline prices. However, details concerning the planned eco-tax are relatively unclear. The production industries could face a reduction in energy tax of roughly 20%; companies with high energy needs are to be exempted from this tax in order to remain competitive. The attained surplus is to be used to reduce social security contributions by 0.8% to 19.5% beginning in 1999.  </field>

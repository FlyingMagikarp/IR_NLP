<field name="text">The head of the SPD parliamentary faction, Mr. Scharping, has demanded accommodation on the part of the government to settle the quarrel concerning the planned tax reform.  Mr. Scharping told DEUTSCHLANDFUNK, if the Coalition continued with its chaotic, frivolous financial policy, it could not count on support from the opposition.  At the same time, he rejected charges that his party was exercising blockade tactics in the Bundesrat [the upper house of the German parliament].  Rather, he continued, good suggestions made by Social Democrats were permanently rejected.  In its compromise procedures, the SPD was aiming for results which would start economic upswing again and would take the burden off businesses.  For this reason, lowering fringe benefits and abolishing the industrial capital tax would be essential.  </field>

<field name="text">The head of the CDU in Parliament, Mr. Schaeuble, has again expressed his warning against the SPD majority's renewing its blockade of the planned tax reform.  Mr Schaeuble told the WDR [West German Radio] that it made no sense to begin initiatives of which one knew that the SPD-head, Mr. Lafontaine would prevent their passage with a "scorched earth policy." Mr. Schaeuble emphasized that the reform package passed by the Coalition government was needed to lower unemployment in Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">At the beginning of the German congress of Silesians in Nuernberg, the Bavarian minister for social matters, Ms. Stamm, emphasized the major progress made in relations with Poland.  Thus, the new Polish constitution was ensuring minority rights to a large extent.  In the meantime, a German-Polish group of historians was currently investigating flight and expulsion from the eastern territories of the former German Reich, she stated.  The federal head of the compatriots, Mr. Rupka (sp?), pointed out that there were still approximately 800 000 Germans living in Upper Silesia today.   Mr. Rupka called for their situation to be improved.  The federal government and the federal parliament had a duty to look after the Silesians, he stated.  Approximately 100 000 participants are expected at the two-day congress of Silesian compatriots.  </field>

<field name="text">It is estimated that ca. one million persons celebrated at the love parade in Berlin.  The Berlin celebration with techno-music and dancing is considered the largest party of the year in the world. The music fans, most of them young people, paraded from Ernst- Reuter-Platz through the Tiergarten to the Brandenburg Gate.  This year, the motto of the love parade is "let the sunshine into your heart."  Because of resistance, 40 punkers, who consider the spectacle too commercial, were taken into custody by the police. The city trains and subways in Berlin were overcrowded.  The flow of traffic temporarily collapsed in one area as it also did in many city streets and on the surrounding Autobahnen .  </field></doc></add>

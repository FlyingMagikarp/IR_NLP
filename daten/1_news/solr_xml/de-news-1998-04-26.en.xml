<field name="text">Over 2 million voters went to the polls today [Sunday] to vote for a new state parliament. Coming eight weeks after the election in Lower Saxony, this election is also considered to be a test run for the national elections in September. A "red-green" minority coalition with Reinhard Hoeppner of the SPD as premier minister is currently in power. The coalition is "tolerated" by the PDS. The CDU with 34.4 percent of the vote would have been the strongest faction four years ago, however the minority opposition forced them into the role of opposition. The SPD received 34 percent of the vote at that time coming second, with the Greens receiving five percent. The PDS had practically 20 percent of the vote.  The SPD gained slightly in today's election. According to the current forecast by the ARD television station [Sunday, 22:00], the Social Democrats will obtain 35.6 percent of the vote. A right-extremist party, the DVU, has been spectacularly successful in attaining 13.1 percent of the vote, thus overcoming the five percent hurdle. The Green Party, which formed part of the previous minority coalition, only attained 3.2 percent of the vote. The CDU had dramatic losses by attaining only 22.1 percent. The PDS approximately maintained their position of four years ago with 19.6 percent. The FDP, which only got 4.2 percent, will not be able to return to the state parliament in Magdeburg.  </field>

<field name="text">All the parties in the election were shocked by the success of the right-extremist party DVU. Christoph Bergner (CDU) said "For me, the worst part of this defeat is that we have lost the moderate voters in Saxony-Anhalt and that the left and right have been strengthened". Mr. Hoeppner of the SPD said "I think that these results demand that we look at things anew, and it is not the time this evening to be talking about coalitions and signals from Bonn, but rather to think about the state of Saxony-Anhalt and its future". Despite his initial commend, Mr. Hoeppner did add that "Christoph Bergner and Helmut Kohl were the obvious losers in this election. Those who try and fool voters and provoke disappointment with the government shouldn't be surprised that they have prepared the ground for potential protests such as found in the DVU".  And the future in Magdeburg? None of the parties want to form a coalition with the German Peoples' Union (DVU). The Greens and the FDP did not manage to get into parliament. Gerhard Schroeder (SPD) has advised the SPD against forming a minority government tolerated by the PDS. Mr. Schroeder called for a stable state government in Magdeburg, which, he said, would not be possible with the PDS. Reinhard Hoeppner is planning to hold talks with the CDU and PDS. The top candidate in the CDU, Mr. Bergner, was contained after the CDU's defeat and said that he did not blame Chancellor Helmut Kohl for the bad results in Saxony-Anhalt. "The current government has done more for Saxony-Anhalt than for any of the other German states. If we want to analyze the situation here, then we must also look at the special situation in our State where parties on the left are only tolerated and a counteractionary right-wing can be formed. In the light of the current election results, I doubt if this is a course of action which looks to the future." The Greens did not manage to get into state parliament. The leader of the Green's parliamentary faction in Bonn, Joschka Fischer, said that these bad results could be blamed on the Green's party conference in Magdeburg where the party called for a petrol price increase to five marks per liter. "This is a bitter defeat for us - there is no way of getting around that. It is a defeat that cannot be blamed, in the end, on those in Saxony-Anhalt who fought a brilliant election campaign. We cannot now limit ourselves to being a party only for West Germany; that would be the worst thing to do. We are now facing very difficult circumstances also in the other East German states, and we must double and triple our efforts there. However, the most important thing is that we understand and react to the voters in our election campaign. The message we sent from the Magdeburg party conference has scared off voters. We have learned this in this election campaign."  </field>

<field name="text">Mr. Huber, the Minister of Finance for Bavaria, has called for a stability pact to be applied to the individual German states and municipalities. Mr. Huber said that the SPD states have till date resisted such a pact. The states and municipalities have to set up stability regulations for the planned European monetary union and for monetary borrowing. Those not adhering to the regulations should be accountable for their actions. He said that Bavaria was not prepared to have to pay millions for debts incurred by the other German states. Theo Waigel, the Federal Minister of Finance, has threatened for several weeks to present his own draft for a national stability pact should the German states not be able to reach agreement.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr. Zickel, the head of IG-Metall (Union for Metal, Engineering and Electronics) has defended trade union campaigns for a change in power in Bonn. He said in an interview that IG-Metall only interfered in politics when they found it necessary, irrespective of whether it is an election campaign or not. He continued that the unions' campaign was necessary as they had determined that the current government was burdening only employees, particularly with their cuts in social welfare areas. The unions' campaign was to encourage employees to involve themselves in politics to protect their own interests. The chairman of IG-Metall still holds to his suggestions that working hours should generally be shortened in order to combat unemployment in Germany. If this did not happen there would be no serious possibility for beating mass unemployment.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag", Germany's military security services (MAD) have even been using ordinary soldiers as undercover investigators in right-extremist circles. According to the report, MAD has used soldiers for many years to infiltrate right-wing groups in order to find out more about their members, their structures and networks. The newspaper gives the example of a regular soldier who was instructed by MAD to reconnoiter the particularly militant National Front. When the danger arose that he would be discovered he was transferred to a military base in the USA. However, even at that distance, the soldier is fearful of revenge from right-wing activists.  </field>

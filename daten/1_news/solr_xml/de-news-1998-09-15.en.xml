<field name="text">Germany's railway company Deutsche Bahn has opened the first high-speed tracks in the eastern states. The new tracks between Hanover and Berlin [where trains can travel at 250 km/h or 155 mph] cost 5 billion DM plus 3 billion for the investments in the Berlin rail infrastructure. The first ICE train to travel between the cities was named after Resistance fighter Claus Graf Stauffenberg. The time for travels between Hanover and Berlin is up to one hour shorter on the new tracks. Environmental group BUND welcomed the project but called on Deutsche Bahn not to build more high-speed tracks but to improve the existing network.  </field>

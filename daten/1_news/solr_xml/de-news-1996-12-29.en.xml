<field name="text">This weekend is the coldest of the year in Germany. Last night, temperatures in Erfurt dropped to -24 degrees Celsius. In Baden-Wuerttemberg a record set in Freudenstadt with -18 C. Meteorologists forecast that it will be slightly less frosty tonight. This morning, snow and drizzle in northern Germany turned roads dangerously slippery. Sanding vehicles have been at work without a break. Physicians warn against carrying children on one's back for a longer time. Bad blood circulation in the child's bent legs in connection with low temperatures could cause frozen legs. Also, shoes should not be tied too tightly.  </field>

<field name="text">New president of the federal union of employers associations Dieter Hundt advocated new models of conflict resolution in the collective bargaining process to avoid labour disputes. Strikes and lock-outs were no longer up-to-date, Hundt said in an interview with news agency DPA. A positive example was the Swiss 'Peace Accord' model that stipulates arbitration without strikes. The bargaining partners have agreed on renouncing all labour dispute actions. Hundt said trade unions and employers should look for new regulations on the occasion of negotiating the reform of regional bargaining agreements.  </field>

<field name="text">The Catholic and Protestant Churches warn against increasing poverty in Germany and count on social market economy. Mr. Langendorfer, Secretary of the German Conference of Bishops, said on Suedwestfunk radio the joint declaration of the churches on the economic and social situation in Germany includes a call for the continuing development of social market economy. This also includes the protection of the environment. The social document of the churches will be presented in February. Langendorfer predicted that the declaration will hurt all parts of society because the churches will not participate in the common blame-the-other game.  </field>

<field name="text">Public TV station ZDF seems to have passed the financial drought. In the past four years revenues from commercials have declined by DM1.7 billion. ZDF director Stolte admitted in the weekly Welt am Sonntag that the programming had suffered under the lack of money, but this would change now. Next year, ZDF will spend DM50 million on entertainment. The station will also more than halve its debts. The money will come from an increase of licence fees [paid by all TV set owners] and from slowly increasing revenues from commercials. As a further step to reduce costs ZDF will cut about 600 jobs until the year 2000, said Stolpe.  </field>

<field name="text">Liechtenstein's justice minister Frommelt has offered Germany Help with uncovering the CDU's hidden accounts. The foundation "Zaunkoenig" created by Hesses's CDU is located in Liechtenstein. Today, Frommelt met with Germany's Minister of Justice Hertha Daeubler-Gmelin. Their topic was a report by Germany's foreign intelligence service BND. In the report Liechtenstein is called a large laundromat for Columbian drug money. Mr. Frommelt complained that the BND's accusations were sweeping generalizations that the BND could not prove. The intelligence coordinator in the Chancellor's Office, Urlau, was refusing Liechtenstein any information. There was not even a German request for official help. Therefore, Frommelt was appreciating even more that at least his colleague had talked to him. Although she considered herself not in charge for some issues, she had promised to do everything in her powers to improve the international cooperation against organized crime. Liechtenstein's justice minister said that his country at any rate would take care that it would not be an attractive place for money launderers of any kind.  </field>

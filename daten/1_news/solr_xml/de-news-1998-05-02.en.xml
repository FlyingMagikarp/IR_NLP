<field name="text"> Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands will be the first president of the new European Central Bank.  Although the regular term of the president is eight years, Mr. Duisenberg is expected to stay in office for only four years and then to resign, freeing the position for his contender, Mr. Criche of France. This arrangement  allowed the French government to achieve a compromise between its own candidate Mr. Criche and the German favorite, Mr. Duisenberg.  The heads of state and government continue to debate the assignments for the other positions of the European Central Bank.  This morning, the European Parliament voted in favor of enacting the European Monetary Union on January 1, 1999. It will encompass eleven countries.  The Parliament thereby has followed the recommendation of the EU Finance Ministers.  </field>

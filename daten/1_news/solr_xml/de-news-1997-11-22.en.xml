<field name="text">The sixty-first state party conference of the CSU closed this afternoon with a guest address by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr. Kohl called the 1100 delegates present from the union parties to show courage and determination in the upcoming federal elections in 1998. The chancellor assured Bavarian prime minister Stoiber his unrestricted support for the state parliamentary elections in Bavaria. Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel had previously been reelected into office as CSU chair for two more years. He received more than eighty-five percent of the delegates' votes. That is about ten percent less than 1995, making this year's outcome the worst in his nine-year tenure as party chair.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of the FDP supports an extension of the mandate of the SFOR international peace troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In an interview with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag," Mr. Kinkel explained that if the troops were called back now, the region would likely regress into chaos and war. For these reasons, Mr. Kinkel is in favor of an extension of the SFOR mission, currently due to expire on June 30 of next year. He stressed that the peace troops should remain under NATO command, and draw on European, as well as Russian and American, soldiers. The NATO ministers of defense are planning to decide on the succession mandate on December 2 in Brussels.  </field>

<field name="text">The conference of cities in Baden-Wuerttemberg has called the governing parties CDU and FDP to change their course in drug policy. The association of communal leaders supports a physiciancontrolled distribution of heroine to those with severe addictions. Yesterday, the conference of health ministers in Saarbruecken also voiced its support for such a program. The speaker of the conference of cities, Mr. Stehle, suggested a model trial. The trail could be conducted in the city of Karlsruhe, which has already volunteered to serve as the site of the experiment. Until now, the majority of the CDU in Baden-Wuerttemberg has been opposed to a liberalization of the state's drug policies.  </field></doc></add>

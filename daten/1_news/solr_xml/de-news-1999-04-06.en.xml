<field name="text">The first refugees from Kosovo are expected to be brought to Germany tomorrow. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the first planes will be reserved primarily for the old, the sick and those in need of aid. The refugees will be brought to Bavaria first, and from there will be divided amongst the various German states according to standard refugee distribution policy. The initial plan is to provide temporary shelter for 10.000 refugees. The Ministry of the Interior stressed that field aid will remain a first priority. Foreign Affairs Minister Fischer said that the systematic forcible displacement of the Kosovar Albanians by Serb forces was being planned long ago. To insiders the operation is known as 'Horseshoe'. The mass displacements are said to have been planned as early as the peace negotiations of Rambouillet. According to British statements, an estimated 1.1 million of the total Kosovan population of 1.8 million are now either on the run or have been forced out of the country.  </field>

<field name="text">The B90/G (the Greens) spokesperson on defence matters, Beer, has demanded a cease-fire in Kosovo. Beer says that the NATO must regain political iniative and offer the Yugoslav President Milosevic a cease-fire through an internationally accepted mediator. The cease-fire must be subject to specific conditions, however. Military action must not be allowed to autonatically lead to the deployment of ground troops. This is also a position held by the lower house of parliament. While making an appearance in the German television programme ZDF-Morgenmagazin Mr. Kirchtag, the Inspector General of the German Armed Forces, stressed that the deployment of NATO-groundtroops in Kosovo will only be considered once a peace agreement has been reached. Such troops would serve exclusively to ensure that an agreement is adhered to and that the returning refugees are protected.  </field>

<field name="text">The number of new AIDS cases in Germany has decreased, reported the Robert-Koch-Institute. While still more than 1400 new cases of AIDS were registered in 1997, the number of registered cases in 1998 declined to 922. The Robert-Koch-Institute attributes the decrease to the application of combination drugs that slow the immunodeficiency virus' spread in the body.

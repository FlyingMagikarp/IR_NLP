<field name="text">The wage settlement in the public sector will cost federal, state and local governments around 6 billion marks.  Thus spoke the finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr. Schleusser, to the Cologne "Express."  The unions had accepted the employers' offer by mid-afternoon.  According to its terms, the 3.2 million employees at the federal, state and local level will receive a raise of 3.1% starting April 1st.  For the months of January through March, employers will pay 300 marks [on top of current salaries].  The contract will be good for 15 months.  Public workers can probably count on cutbacks in overtime.  This is to be addressed by an industry-wide agreement expected for July.  Otto Schily who, as Minister of the Interior, was the lead negotiator for the federal government, said that a 3.1% increase would be a great burden for federal, state and local governments.  But he added that public sector wages should not lag behind the private sector.  At three rounds of discussion, this was the shortest wage negotiation the public sector has ever experienced.  </field>

<field name="text">In an interview, Chancellor Schroeder assured "Die Welt am Sonntag" that there will be no cut-backs in road construction in order to improve the train system.  What Schroeder literally said was that the government would support the mobility of the citizens, which was based on cars and founded on roads. The coalition agreement between the SPD and the Greens states that expenditures on road and rail construction will be equalized by stages in order to modernize the rail network.  </field>

<field name="text">Several thousand anti-nuclear demonstrators protested against building a long-term nuclear waste storage facility at Gorleben.  In addition, they made clear their opposition to more Castor transports.  According to the protestors, the red/green coalition doesn't have a clue how to proceed despite their plans for a nuclear power pull-out.  As far as they are concerned, that will only happen if there is pressure from below.  The Minister of the Environment, Juergen Trittin, announced today that there would be no Castor shipments this year.  </field>

<field name="text">Police in several East German cities fear that there will be clashes between members of the extreme right-wing NPD and counter-demonstrators. The NPD has fought at several levels of the judiciary for the right to march in Magdeburg, in the Brandenburg town of Angermuende, and the Saxon town of Wurzen.  The NPD is dead set against giving German citizenship to immigrants. Ten youths were arrested in the vicinity of Angermuende for disseminating Nazi propaganda.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">The Social Democrats rejected the federal government's criticism of the unions' election campaign activities. In Bonn, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine called it the DGB's duty to talk about unemployment. According to a statement released by the SPD, the unions should be allowed to represent their opinions offensively. According to DGB-leader Schulte, his organisation does not make any voting recommendations for a party or a coalition. He said that the DGB campaign was only intended to demand employment and social justice. Minister of Employment Norbert Bluem warned the DGB of being the extended arm of one political party. FDP leader Gerhardt called the union action unacceptable because of its being financed through membership contributions by members with different political opinions. Both politicians rejected the proposal of OETV-leader Mai to introduce a 30-hour work week as being an inefficient means against unemployment.  </field>

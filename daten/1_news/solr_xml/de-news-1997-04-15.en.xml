<field name="text">No breakthrough was reached even after the second tax summit round between the coalition government and the SPD. Both sides, however, agreed on another meeting next week conducted by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and head of SPD Oskar Lafontaine. After today's talks at the Chancellor's Office, Mr Lafontaine said he believed settling the dispute was now possible. The Chancellor stressed the coalition and the SPD had to make all efforts to come to an agreement. He could not forecast the outcome, though, added Mr Kohl.  The main point of controversy seems to be still the refinancing of the planned tax reform. Mr Lafontaine pointed out that, in his opinion, the loss in revenues has not been properly taken care of in the concept of the coalition government, yet.  Finance Minister Theo Waigel claimed the Social Democrats were overestimating the loss in revenues caused by the tax reform and that they have not taken into account the reform's effects in stimulating growth and the creation of new jobs.  </field>

<field name="text">The German federation of unions (DGB) opposes head of IG Metall union Klaus Zwickel's plan to reduce the weekly working time to 32 hours. DGB head, Mr Schulte, said at an employers meeting in Baden-Baden that with the plan for a 4-day working week an "avant-garde aiming point" for the inner-union discussion has been set. Hardly any unionist was so unrealistic to still see a chance for any schematic working time regulation. Independantly from this discussion, however, all necessary changes of the unions' working time policies had to be done now, such as the reduction of over-time, the increase of the number of part-time jobs with social insurance or for semi-retired persons, Mr Schulte added.  </field>

<field name="text">President of the employers' association, Mr Hundt, advocates state subsidies for low-payed, simple jobs. Thousands of jobs could be created if wages for this kind of jobs were decreased by 25 to 30 per cent, said Mr Hundt to the journal "Stern", published in Hamburg. These low wages could be topped up by social welfare payments. This could considerably decrease social welfare payments because people who now receive full welfare would have to be paid only partial welfare, the employers' association's president added.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Health Minister Horst Seehofer has asked physicians not to be over-cautious in prescribing cures. It now seems, that after calls for cuts on health care spending, the existing budget for cures will hardly be used up, Mr Seehofer said in Wiesbaden. Especially the Muetter-Genesungswerk organisation [Agency for Convalescing Mothers] has now many free places although the cures they offer are not affected at all by the saving measures.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Labour Office payed out almost six billion mark in unemployment assistance in the first three months of the year. This is an increase of almost DM800mio compared to the first quarter of 1996. According to the autority, the first quarter payments reflect a third of this year's budget for unemployment assistance. The SPD called long-time unemployment an "explosive charge" for the budget.  </field>

<field name="text">Consumer prices in Germany fell by 0.2 per cent in March compared to February. According to details from the Federal Department of Statistics, this was a result of seasonal decrease in the cost of fuel oil and fresh groceries. However, in comparison to March 1996, there has actually been a price increase of 1.5 per cent.  The statisticians believe that rent prices, which rose by 2.7 per cent during the report time, were the main cause of the increase.  </field>

<field name="text">Joachim Gauck, Federal Commissioner for the Stasi files, the files of the former East German secret service, has pointed out the continuing interest in dealing with East German history. Five years after the law concerning the access to the Stasi files came into effect, Mr Gauck said on Deutschlandfunk radio that every month his authority receives 15,000 to 20,000 new demands from people who want to have a look at their files. This proves that it has been right to open the archives. According to what he said, some 935,000 demands of private persons have been processed up to now.  </field>

<field name="text">In south west Germany, the second largest regional center within the ARD public broadcasting group will be set up in the next couple of years. The new station, result of merging the two stations "Suedwestfunk (SWF)" and "Sueddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR)", will be called "Suedwestrundfunk (SWR)". A corresponding treaty was paraphed by the State Premiers of Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg, Mr Beck and Mr Teufel, today. The treaty now has to pass the parliaments of the two states.  It is the intention of the two state governments, that separate TV channels with mostly cultural and educational content will be produced in each capital, Mainz and Stuttgart. Further, each city will produce two radio channels targeting a general audience. The existing channels with mostly pop music content will be merged and produced in Baden-Baden alone.  The heads of SWF and SDR, Mr Voss and Mr Fuenfgeld, welcomed the agreement of the State Premiers. They, however, stated that they would check whether the treaty assures a "guarantee for development" of the new station in the sense of the Freedom of Broadcasting Act.  </field>

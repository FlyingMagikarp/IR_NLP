<field name="text">Dear Party Colleagues, I hereby declare my resignation from the office of the Chair of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.  I thank you and the members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany for the friendly cooperation and the trust.  I wish you success in your future work for freedom, justice and solidarity.  The first special reports came shortly before 6:00 PM.  Oskar Lafontaine unexpectedly resigned as Finance Minister.  Government spokesman Heye further reported that Lafontaine had also given up his position as leader of the Social Democrats.  What prompted Lafontaine to make this surprising move is momentarily still unclear.  As is generally know in the past there has been a range of differences and strained relations between Schroeder and Lafontaine.  Besides the basic differences of opinion over economic policies, the two SPD politicians also had different views on dealing with the PDS.  In yesterdays cabinet meeting the Chancellor rebuked Lafontaine for allegedly false calculations of the atomic power plant operators' reserve fund payments.  In his first comments Gerhard Schroeder stated that he regretted Lafontaines decision and was also surprised by it.  The leader of the Union caucus, Wolfgang Schaeuble, described the resignation of Lafontaine as Writing on the wall for the insubstantiality of Schroeders government.  Lafontaine apparently did not want to be responsible for the damage the red-green coalition had already caused in the country.  FPD leader Wolfgang Gerhardt called the resignation of Lafontaine overdue.  He explained that now the political course also needed to be corrected.  Lafontainess one-dimensional oriented demand politics had come to nothing Bavarian SPD leader, Renate Schmidt, regretted Lafontaines resignation. She also said that the resignation was certainly not easy for Schroeders government and that it was too early to talk about personnel alternatives.  The SPD managing committee would confer on the situation tomorrow.  The leader of the CSU caucus, Gleuk stated that the resignation of Lafontaine was a sign of the chaotic leadership of Chancellor Schroeder.  Lafontaine was the first to realize the consequences of the chancellors unbelievable leadership style.  </field>

<field name="text">Shortly before the deciding coalition round over the so-called dual passport, Minister of Interior Schily took up fresh talks with the Mainz state government over the so-called Option Model.  The red-green government is dependent upon the votes of the social- liberal coalition in Mainz for the voting in the upper house of parliament. Rhineland Palatinate FDP Chair Reiner Bruederle stated that he expected an agreement.  The point of contention for the FDP is tolerating double citizenship for foreigners who are older than 60 or who have lived in Germany for more than 30 years.  The questions as to what age a foreigner must chose a citizenship is also open.  </field>

<field name="text">After three weeks of negotiations the European Union Ministers of Agriculture have come to an agreement on the planned agriculture reform.  They agreed to lower the prices for agriculture products, grains and beef prices by 20% and milk prices by 15%.  The president of the German Farmers' Association, Gerd Sonnleiter rejected these plans stating, his group demanded compensation, for example in the social sector.  These high costs burdened their family businesses and the group attempted to get compensation from the new government, so that the havoc in agriculture would not become too great.  It would become havoc if the farmers took on national burdens like tax reform or an environmental tax.  If they totaled up the agenda now the cup would be full with what has befallen the farmers and what was expected of them.  State Premier Stoiber stated the farmers had to pay the check.  According to Stoiber, as a result of the decisions of the EU-Agriculture Ministers, in Bavaria alone between 10,000 and 15,000 farms would have to close-up shop.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bavarian Agriculture Minister apologized to Chancellor Schroeder for making a connection between Bonns nuclear policy and the Third Reich.  He stated on Bavarian Radio that such a comparison had never been his intention.  In Brussels, Bavaria's State Premier expressed his approval of his ministers apology, stating, he assumed that Mr. Wiesheu had, with his public apology and his personal explanation to the Chancellor, taken care of his mistake.  The minister went on to say that, of course one is not permitted to say everything, there is no question of that, but in political discussions again and again there are mistakes of one kind or another or perhaps also bad mistakes.  But the minister believes it also had to be recognized when someone immediately admitted that he had made a mistake and apologizes.  A person can do no more and one should accept it. Wiesheu had declared in an interview about Bonns nuclear politics that there had already been someone in Germany who had wanted final solutions to questions and after 12 years he had come to an end.  </field>

<field name="text">After an eventual withdrawal from nuclear energy Bavaria wants to import nuclear power from other countries, according to State Chancery Leader Huber.  He offered as a basis for this policy that the economic recovery in the Free State (Bavaria) was closely tied to inexpensive nuclear power.  For that reason imports, from France for example were being considered.  The closing of nuclear power plants would have greater impact in Bavaria than in other states, since there in comparison to other states there would not be sufficient coal powered plants available.  </field>

<field name="text">Criminals in Bavaria must soon reckon with loss of their drivers license even when nooffences in the traffic area are involved.  The justice committee of the state parliament is considering similar bills from the CSU and SPD.  The two parties offered as a basis for their proposals that fines had only limited effect, imprisonment on the other hand, would, in many cases, be inappropriate.  </field>

<field name="text">The premiums for the pension plan will increase to 20.3% of the employees' gross salary on January 1st, according to Federal Employment Minister Bluem. In parliament, Bluem argued that declining revenues, caused by poor economic performance, necessitate this move.  This year, the pension plan premiums are at 19.2%.  The SPD expert for social policy, Mr. Dressler, spoke of a loss of credibility of government policy made by the CDU/CSU and FDP who are responsible for the fact that people have to work longer, but receive less pension.  </field>

<field name="text">The National Trade Union Federation (DGB) will not delay the enactment of its new statute.  The delegates at the extraordinary national convention in Dresden rejected corresponding requests with a vast majority.  Several unions within the umbrella organization found that some articles of the new manifesto are not sufficiently aggressive in tone.  Numerous requests for alterations will still be discussed, however, before the final vote on Saturday. IG-Metall [union for metal and electronics industries] chairman Mr. Zwickel was heavily criticized for threatening to depart from the conference if these requests were to be accepted.  In the preliminaries of the DGB convention, several unions including the IG Medien [union for mass media], as well as the unions for Postal Service and wood industry had voiced reservations against the statute and demanded postponement.  In their opinion, the period of consultations was too short.  In particular they criticized the draft's fundamental acceptance of social market economy.  The DGB continued to define its role as a counterweight to employers and corporate power, and as a warrior against the destruction of the social net. The preamble proclaims the right to strike.   The completely new statute will replace the one from 1981.  </field>

<field name="text">The government's decision to not take part in an international aid mission to help the refugees in Zaire has been criticized as premature by the SPD.  As the deputy chair of the SPD parliamentary group, Mr. Verheugen, said on "Saarlaendischer Rundfunk" radio, the details of the mission should have been evaluated prior to making the decision.  He said the government's rigorous refusal stands in contradiction to the Coalition's policy to have Germany assume more responsibilities in the international handling of crises. Vanguards of American and French troops have arrived in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, today.  New fighting has been reported today in the vicinity of the city of Gomar in East Zaire.  </field>

<field name="text">Today, the Bundestag has responded with legislative measures to the violent riots of militant Kurds this spring.  The bill, passed with the votes of CDU/CSU and FDP, contains provisions facilitating the expulsion of criminal foreigners.  An expulsion will also result if a foreigner is convicted of a severe case of disruption of peace or of disruption of peace at an unauthorized protest rally.  The parties of the Opposition had opposed the Coalition's proposal.  During the parliamentary debate, the SPD representative Ms. Sonntag-Wohlgast said the penal provisions of the government's draft are inadequate.  She demanded clear regulations to help foreigners integrate in society.  Member of Parliament Ms. Mueller, of Alliance 90/The Greens, believes that the legal basis for aliens will worsen.  Representatives of SPD and Alliance 90/The Greens criticized the reform and demanded clear models for the social integration of aliens. The spokesman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Mr. Marschewski, defended the bill.  Interior Minister Kanther reminded the Opposition of their position during the Kurd riots this spring, when they too had demanded that criminal foreigners be expelled as quickly as possible. Previously, the FDP Secretary General Mr. Westerwelle had underscored his party's demand to change the naturalization and nationality law.  Children of foreigners living in Germany should have the opportunity to be integrated as Germans.   The change in immigration law has now to be passed by the SPD-dominated Bundesrat.  It is expected that a mediation committee will be called upon.  </field>

<field name="text">The budget debate has run into an argument between Government and Opposition about the planned savings of 3 billion DM.  Therefore, all involved Ministers are to be summoned before the budget subcommittee and demonstrate down to the penny at which projects they want to cut funds.

It is, however, questionable if all Ministers will appear before the committee, as was voiced in Coalition circles.  Subsidies for coal mining will also be affected by the budget savings 1997.

<field name="text">In Berlin, in the trial against four former members of the SED [former state party of the GDR] politburo the prosecution has requested that the suspension of imprisonment, which had previously been announced by the 17th grand penal chamber of the Regional Court, be revoked.  The prosecution demanded that the arrest warrants for the former GDR head of state and party, Mr. Krenz, as well as for Mr. Dolus, Mr. Kleiber, and Mr. Schabowski be executed.  The prosecution argues that the risk of escape prevails, since all four of the accused have to expect long prison sentences.  The Regional Court had previously issued arrest warrants for the former members of the politburo, but suspended their execution.  However, Krenz, Dolus, Kleiber, and Schabowski have to surrender their passports.  In the eyes of the court, this would contain the risk of escape.  After the arrest warrants were announced, Egon Krenz repeated his opinion that he would not recognize any decision by a federal court.  His lawyer said that the arrest warrants manifest that the court folded under public pressure.  The fact that the arrest warrants were suspended means for the accused that they will remain free, but are subject to certain conditions.  They have to turn in their passports, have to remain in Berlin or Brandenburg, and have to report to the police weekly.  Krenz, Schabowski and the other members of the SED politburo are indicted for multiple manslaughter and attempted manslaughter of border crossers.  The Constitutional Court had come to a fundamental decision that such deeds from the GDR era are punishable under the law of the Federal Republic of Germany.  </field>

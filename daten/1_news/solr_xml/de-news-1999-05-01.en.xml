<field name="text">NATO is continuing its attacks on Yugoslavia with the heaviest bombardment so far.  Current objectives are to wipe out the military communication networks of the Yugoslav army and to disrupt supply lines for fuel, spare parts and food.  23 people have probably been killed during an attack on a bridge in Kosovo.  An AFP spokesman reported that a bus was hit by at least one missile.  Serb media denounced the action as a massacre on civilians. NATO has not yet confirmed the incident.  </field>

<field name="text">Oskar Lafontaine---as an individual without tenure of a public office---gave an address on May 1 in the Saarbruecken entertainment park "German-French Garden."  The topics of his first big speech after his resignation centered around the labor market and predominantly the war in Kosovo.  He said it was a mistake to officially recognize the patchwork of small states within former Yugoslavia.  In addition to that grave mistakes have been committed during the last two weeks, Lafontaine continued.  They were the exclusion of the United Nations and the exclusion of Russia from the negotiations to end the Kosovo crisis.  According to Lafontaine, the NATO bomb attacks have led into a dead end. At issue is no longer a face-saving strategy for NATO, but to stop the suffering and agony of the people that was created by the bombardments. In the part of his speech regarding the labor market, Lafontaine demanded a growth-oriented wage policy and the dismissal of the ideology of price stability. Lafontaine did not make any remarks critical of the federal government or Chancellor Schroeder, but rather encouraged the government to continue on its route.  </field>

<field name="text">At the traditional May 1st Labor Day celebrations, the union leaders' addresses focused on the Kosovo crisis.  At the main rally in Dortmund, head of the National Trade Union Federation (DGB) Dieter Schulte admonished both NATO and the Yugoslav leadership.  He called on President Milosevic to end the mass murder and to stop his inhuman actions.  Otherwise there would never be peace in the Balkans.  Secondly, Mr. Schulte urged NATO to exploit every possibility to return to the negotiating table; for peace in the Balkans requires a contribution from every party.  The people must be able to return to their homes and must be able to live their lives in freedom and dignity, Mr. Schulte reasoned.  On the traditional subject of Labor Day, there were some changes to report from the unions' standpoint. May 1st 1999 marks the first Labor Day celebration since 1982 with the government again under social-democratic control and the first joint rally between DGB and DAG [National Union of Employees] since much longer ago.  The main topic was hence an amicable one, namely the joining of DGB and DAG, the National Trade Union Federation and the National Union of Employees. After DGB and DAG had faced each other as opponents for almost 50 years, the four service sector unions within the DGB together with the DAG want to lay the foundations for a joint organization before the turn of the millennium, forming the world's largest independent union with 3.3 million members.  DGB head Dieter Schulte and DAG head Roland Issen not only exchanged niceties with one another, but the federal government also received a fair share of praise.  They endorsed the government tax reform and the employment program for youths. The government should not let itself be deterred by the complaints of industry and entrepreneurs. However, Schulte and Issen, both members of the SPD, circumvented volatile issues such as taxing the so-called 630 Marks jobs [McJobs] [presently tax-free] or legislative measures against pretense self-employment.  These topics had recently evoked strong criticism in the population.  The two union leaders, nonetheless, called for resistance against the dismantling of the social security network.  </field>

<field name="text">After a twelve-week delay, the Goethe National Museum has finally been opened in Weimar.  The building, which had been renovated for 18 million marks, offers an unusual view of the Weimar classics.  Minister of Culture Naumann said Goethe had lived on for posteriority so that his grandeur would inspire each of us.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">Government politicians have partly supported author Guenter Grass's statements on the refugee and Turkey politics after biting criticism by the federal government. Deputy leader of the CDU/CSU faction Heiner Geissler said in an interview there was no guarantee that Kurds are not tortured in Turkey or imprisoned unlawfully. At the same time, Mr. Geissler disapproved of arms exports to Turkey. The Government Commissioner for Foreigners Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen (FDP) said Grass's words contained a core of bitter truth such as those about latent anti-foreigner attitudes but he had also exaggerated several points in his speech. For example, Germany was not a state with arbitrary rule.  </field>

<field name="text">Protests against a possible reduction of civil servant salaries continue. State Premier Kurt Beck (SPD) of Rhineland-Palatinate and Finance Minister Huber (CSU) of Bavaria are against further special sacrifices. Mr. Huber said cuts in the social support system of the public service were indeed necessary but they had to be appropriate. The public service must not become the nation's piggy bank. He also reminded that only last year the salaries of young civil servants had been increased to strengthen the performance principle. The state finance ministers will discuss on Thursday amongst others reduction of salaries for newly employed civil servants, reductions of Christmas gratifications, and the abolishment of the pension equalization.  </field>

<field name="text">The criminal immunity of officers of the future European police authority will be brought before the Bundestag according to a decision by the federal cabinet. The European Union wants that Europol officers cannot be held criminally responsible for offences while on duty. There are constitutional considerations against this rule. Originally, the government wanted to regulate the immunity as a by-law without parliamentary involvement. Now the government decided to draft a law because of the political explosiveness.  </field>

<field name="text">The net incomes must rise to increase the domestic demand, according to Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. The Bundesbank states in its latest monthly report that this should be achieved not only by higher wages but also by lower taxes. Therefore, the Bundesbank called on the parties in Bonn to significantly reduce the difference between gross and net incomes. At the same time, the Bundesbank advocated moderate income raises in the coming years. To decrease mass unemployment there also had to be more competitive jobs.  </field>

<field name="text">Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of the CSU/CDU Bundestag faction is aiming at a compromise with coalition partner FDP in the argument about "DM610-jobs" [jobs not covered by social insurance]. Schaeuble welcomed signals from the FDP that they were ready for talks. He said the argument was not as exciting as it was presented in public. Mr. Schaeuble, however, did not want to discuss any concrete plans how to reduce the abuse of less-than-part-time jobs. He stressed though that CDU/CSU did not plan to abolish DM610-jobs because that would only encourage moonlighting. Mr. Schaeuble suggested to discuss the topic in an expert hearing. The Liberals underlined that jobs exempt from social security contributions must be retained. Lower Saxony's State Premier Gerhard Schroeder advocated to introduce a company quota of 10 percent or less for DM610-jobs.  </field>

<field name="text">If the Social-Democrats win the next general elections they will make the fight against unemployment and the creation of social justice the focus of their politics. Party leader Oskar Lafontaine announced during the SPD congress "Innovation and Justice" that the Social-Democrats wanted to do everything to abolish mass unemployment. Germany needed a new government that understands the economic trade. His party would also make sure that freedom, justice, and solidarity regain their role as leading principles for change in society. Lafontaine announced the SPD would start a programme against youth unemployment immediately after their election victory. They wanted to give each youth the opportunity of education. When the economy was not capable of this, the government had to take over. Lafontaine called for a reduction of work time and taxes, a tax reform that increases the consumer potential of employees and incentives for environmental investments and energy saving. According to Lafontaine Chancellor Kohl had showed that he could not give the country a new upward trend. It was not the country that was weak but the government.  </field>

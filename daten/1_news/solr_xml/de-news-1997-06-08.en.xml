<field name="text">Edmund Stoiber, the prime minister of Bavaria, has demanded the strict adherence to the Maastricht criteria for monetary union; convergence should determine the timetable, Mr. Stoiber said. Monetary union should rather be delayed, instead of lessening the criteria for monetary union. He said that a common currency for Europe meant a union "for better or worse", and that it was a "marriage" which could not be dissolved.  </field>

<field name="text">The president of the Federal Association of German Banks, Mr. Kohlhausen, has entered the discussion on the convergence criteria for monetary union. He said to the Sunday newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" that it was acceptable if Germany had a net national debt of 3.2 or 3.3. percent. The three percent limit set by Maastricht took this into account, according to Mr. Kohlhausen. A lasting policy of stability after the introduction of the Euro was much more important than the extent of the new debt. He thus hoped that the Federal Minister of Finance, Theo Waigel, be prepared to deviate from his current policy.  </field>

<field name="text">The argument over the reorganisation of the budget and tax increases is leading to an ever increasing endurance test for the governing coalition. Minister of Finance Waigel announced further drastic austerity measures while referring to the 1998 budget. Mr. Waigel said that it was essential to make extreme savings in all areas. He said that there should be no taboo areas and he could not even rule out increasing national debt. Even benefits  and subsidies would have to be re-examined. In the light of the austerity measures undertaken by federal, state and communal government, Mr. Waigel was confident that Germany would meet the criteria for monetary union. The rumour, however, that the Federal Labour Office alone would face cuts of over 2 billion marks this year caused furore in opposition ranks. Rudolf Scharping,the Head of the SPD parliamentary fraction, said that such measures would result in an additional 200 000 unemployed. The expert for social affairs for the Greens, Ms. Andrea Fisher, said that this confirmed that the governing coalition was absolutely desperate.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Health Minister Seehofer and the public health insurance companies foresee the possibility of not increasing premiums in Western Germany until the end of next year. Presenting the semi-annual financial report for the public insurance companies, Seehofer said that, despite a deficit of about DM 4 billion in the first half of 1997, rate increases could be done without, in the middle term. He added, however, that that was assuming the companies continued to cut back expenses. Expenditures for services are down about 1 percent so far this year, while monies coming in have remained constant. Due to the difficult financial situation in Eastern Germany, premium increases could not be ruled out. Several of the large public insurance companies have announced that they would leave the premiums there untouched on the condition that no "solidarity funds" were used to compensate for the deficit in the East.  </field>

<field name="text">Moscow, Russia. Federal President Herzog has ended the official part of his state visit in Russia. Speaking before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Duma, Herzog called on Russians and Germans to quickly expand upon the cooperation already in evidence between the two peoples. Herzog called on the Russian deputies to seek out partnership with the West, and to avoid old-style power politics. He promised Germany's continuing support for democratic reforms in Russia, for the sake of a common future in peace. Herzog thanked Russian President Yeltsin for his hospitality, saying he was met with an "unbelievably heartfelt atmosphere". Following Herzog's appearance, a communist deputy presented him with a resolution, in the name of the majority of Duma members, in support of former East German leader Egon Krenz, who was sentenced to six and a half years' imprisonment last week in Berlin. To finish his visit, Herzog has flown to Samara on the Volga River to take part in celebrations as Sara and Stuttgart are officially named sister cities.  </field>

<field name="text">More than a year and a half after presenting a 50-point programme to encourage investment and jobs, Federal Economic Minister Rexrodt has judged it a success. In an interim report which Rexrodt presented to the cabinet today, he indicated that almost all of the planned measures had been realized or at least initiated. The economic upswing is gaining momentum, German companies are more competitive and the long-awaited turn-around in the labour markets is getting closer, according to Rexrodt. The Economic Ministry is projecting 4.2 million unemployed for 1998, however; that is about 100,000 fewer than at present.  </field>

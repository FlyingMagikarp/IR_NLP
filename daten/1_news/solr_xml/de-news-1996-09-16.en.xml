<field name="text">The trial against the Lebanese Safwan Eid began under heavy security at the Regional Court today. He is accused of having set fire to a hostel for refugees last January. Ten people were killed and 38 injured. The defendant and his family will be heard during the first two days of the trial. Since it is uncertain whether Safwan Eid was born on November 10, 1972 or on November 1,1975, he is standing trial at the juvenile criminal court. No confession or witnesses exist, and there are also questions about a conclusive motive. The main witness for the prosecution is a paramedic who claims to have heard Safwan Eid say the words "We did it." The defendant claims that he was misunderstood. According to the DA, conversations tapped while the defendant was in pretrial detention nurse the suspicion. Nevertheless, the Lebanese citizen had to be released before the start of the trial because the juvenile court did not see an imminent suspicion. Experts argue over the question where the fire started. The prosecution assumes that it started on the second floor, whereas the defense considers the first floor the scene of the crime, thus supporting its theory of an assault from the outside. Several initiatives support this thesis. 60 witnesses will be heard during the first ten days of the trial.  </field>

<field name="text">The Greens were the only party able to gain votes in the communal elections in Lower Saxony. They reached a total of 9 percent after a gain of 2.7 percent. The other parties suffered losses of up to 1.4 percent. Despite the savings measures passed by the federal government, the CDU remained the strongest party with 41.6 percent, according to the preliminary official results. The SPD received 38.5 percent and the FDP 4.6 percent. The parties deliberate today on the results of the election. Once again the FDP missed the magical 5 percent hurdle. CDU secretary general Hintze said that his party was clearly the winner. He rated the result as a confirmation of the CDU's set course for economic growth and employment. SDP federal manager Muentefering said that the Social Democrats would have to learn from this result. The positions of the SPD had to be clear and unmistakable in order to mobilize as many people as possible for the elections. The spokesperson for the Alliance90/The Greens called the result a warning shot for the coalition in Bonn. According to pollsters, the election was a protest vote against the established parties, on which the Greens and communal electoral groups were able to capitalize.  </field>

<field name="text">The trial against 37-year old filmmaker Michael Born started today at the Regional Court.

Born confessed during the trial that he committed the forgery, saying that one of the films he made up was about looting in eastern Germany.

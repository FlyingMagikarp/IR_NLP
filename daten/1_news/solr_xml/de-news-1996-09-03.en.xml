<field name="text"> Retail employers and employees in Bavaria have reached an agreement which, according to the union, could be used as a pilot.  The agreement provides for a twenty percent wage increase for sales personnel after 6:30 p.m., and after 2:00 p.m. on Saturdays beginning in November.  Employees will forfeit the increase on one Saturday per month and on the Saturdays before Christmas, however.  They will not have to work overtime more than three evenings per week or three Saturdays per month.  Overtime will not be required of employees with children younger than 12 or who require special care, or employees who can not get home with public transportation.  In addition, employees will receive a monthly pay increase of 1.85 percent - but no less than five DM - retroactive back to May 1st.  All employees will also receive a 2.5 percent increase in their Christmas bonuses, which amounts to about 80 DM per year on the average.  The employers therefore made another financial concession, but there is no direct compensation for the one Saturday per month without overtime pay, as the unions had demanded.  </field>

<field name="text">Two days before the opening statements in the trial against Peter Graf for tax evasion, new allegations have arisen against the father of the tennis star.  The focus of the latest Graf sage is a 36-year old accomplice who is under arrest for instigating breach of trust, receiving stolen goods, and breaking the weapons law.  He claims that Peter Graf asked him to turn on a partner locked up in a Karlsruhe jail with Jochen Eckert, the Grafs  tax advisor.  He was to help Jochen Eckert remember the 8 to 10 million DM missing from Peter Graf s account - with a baseball bat if necessary.  Officials even suspect that some of the Grafs  funds were skimmed off.  It is missing, at any rate.  The prisoner allegedly approached by Peter Graf did not pick up a baseball bat after all, but turned to the authorities instead, possibly to earn extra points in his upcoming trial.  The prosecutor s office has been investigating the case for months, with no end in sight.  The prisoner allegedly approached by Peter Graf has been transferred to another full security facility for safety.  </field>

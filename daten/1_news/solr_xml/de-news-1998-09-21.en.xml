<field name="text">All over Europe, the reaction of politicians and media to the publicizing of President Clinton's deposition was one of nausea and revolt. Chancellor Kohl declared himself shocked by the way the affair was being handled. "It's so sickening I'd like to vomit", he said. SPD's boss Gerhard Schroeder said the transmission was sickening and nauseating. The media union appealed to German TV companies not to broadcast the recording. Freedom of the press and of information is not the supreme value, they said. Baden-Wuerttemberg's premier Teufel said the transmission of the tape by public channel "Phoenix" was a scandal. It is unconceivable to him that even public broadcasting was playing along with this kind of smut theater. The manner in which the affair is being aired publicly he called "a disgusting show".  </field>

<field name="text">One week before election day, SPD and CDU, the major parties, set their aim at getting secondary (party-list) votes. CDU leadership in Bonn decided on a general appeal to this effect. Chancellor Kohl repeated his stand excluding any idea of "great coalition" (meaning joint Union/SPD government). SPD chairman Lafontaine announced that his party was going to stress the importance of secondary votes for candidate Schroeder's victory.

<field name="text">8 years after Germany was reunited, bargaining partners in the metalworking and electrical sectors strive for a nationwide wage agreement. This was the consensus reached at a summit meeting between the industries' employers' federation and the union IG Metall. Both entities stated that a pilot agreement worked out in one of the Western regions will be applied in the "new" (East German) states with a one month grace period. Until the end of the year 2000, a 38 hour week was established. The "emergency clause", permitting companies in a difficult economical situation to temporarily pay wages below the agreed rates, will be extended.  </field>

<field name="text">Security measures in Bavaria were reinforced after the arrest of suspected terrorist Salim. State  minister of the interior Beckstein had announced that the 40-year old Arab confirmed his identity. Salim also confessed to knowing bin Laden, who is suspected of masterminding the terrorist attacks against US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, although he denied having been involved in the actions. It is reported that Salim was in charge of finances and weapons procurement within the bin Laden organization. Bavarian authorities will apply for a warrant of arrest and extradition against Salim by tomorrow at the latest. They had arrested Salim near Munich last week. In the US, Salim is under suspicion of being bin Laden's finance manager and therefore co-responsible for the terrorist attacks against US embassies in Africa.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">The parliamentary factions of Social-Democrats and Buendnis90/Die Gruenen (B90/G) have approved the bill for the eco tax. This clears the way for introducing the bill in the Bundestag for its first reading on Friday. The coalition intends to have the law in effect by January 1. The eco tax is to garner 11.3 billion marks next year. The government wants to use the money to reduce the contributions to the pension plan by 0.8 percentage points to 19.5 percent. The bill provides that taxes on gasoline and diesel increase by 6 pfennigs, heating fuel by 4 pfennigs per litre. Gas prices will rise by 0.32 pfennigs and electricity by 2 pfennigs per kilowatt-hour (kWh), specially priced power for night storage heaters will increase by 1 pfennig per kWh. B90/G resolved that also in future the eco tax alone is to finance the reduction of wage fringe costs.  </field>

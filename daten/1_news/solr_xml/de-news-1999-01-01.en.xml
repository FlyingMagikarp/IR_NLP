<field name="text">As of 1 January it's euro year - in Germany and 10 more EU-member countries. Federal government, Mr Santer, president of the EU-Commission and Mr Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, called this a historic moment. In the financial metropolis of Frankfurt/Main several thousand people celebrated the introduction of the euro, a currency that will be used exclusively for non-cash transactions, for the time being. As of tomorrow, however, cheques, debit- as well as credit-cards may be made out in euro. Financial instruments made out in national currencies will stay in circulation for another 3 years. One euro is worth almost 1.96 German marks.  </field>

<field name="text">Several thousand staff of European banks did not have a New Year's Eve party. They had to convert computer systems, as trading in shares and bonds will be in euro only as of Monday. The Dresdner Bank, for example, will have to cope with 9000 modifications to their banking software, at a cost of 250 million marks. Yesterday the EU ministers of finance and economics pegged the exchange rates of the euro. Now one euro is worth almost 1.96 German marks.  </field>

<field name="text">As of today Germany will chair the European Council, for the next 6 months. The most important goals are, according to Chancellor Schroeder, reaching an agreement on the subscriptions to the EU common treasury (some are net-takers, others net-payers), the reform of European agriculture and regional policies as well as the planned European covenant for employment. Fighting unemployment is on top of Germany's list of priorities. There has to be a European covenant for employment, that's what 15 member states had agreed on during their recent summit-meeting in Vienna. That will be one of the items in the chair's  'very easy' basket. The planned EU reforms, however, will be a bigger problem. The 15 member states want to reach an agreement on this issue during a planned special summit meeting in March. The EU has to become ready and prepared for new memberships by Eastern European countries.  </field>

<field name="text">There have been numerous accidents, fires and brawls during this New Year's Eve's revelling. In Leipzig some 50 rioters set up barricades in the streets and battled with police. In the Upper Palatinate an intoxicated arms buff shot at his girlfriend with a crossbow and threatened 10 other persons. He finally was arrested, after he had broken a leg. In the Hochsauerland district a 30-year old man sustained life-threatening injuries after fiddling with gunpowder. Now the whole house is about to collapse, following the explosion in the cellar. All the same, police were full of praise for this year's mainly peaceful end-of-year revelling. People had been disciplined while having a ball.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Brie, member of the executive of the PDS party, criticised his own party. In spite of the success at the federal election and having become a partner in the coalition governing the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania he thought that there were substantial shortcomings as far as contents and strategies were concerned, when interviewed by the newspaper BERLINER ZEITUNG. The party especially was unable to live up to its manifesto's stipulation, namely that they would be left of the SPD. The PDS would be a world-champion with words, but lacked the substance to back them.  </field>

<field name="text">As of 1 January 1999 the exchange rates of the euro to most of the European currencies are set in stone, and will not fluctuate at all any more. That's why we will skip them in the future. We will, however, quote other exchange rates and economic indicators.  </field></doc></add>

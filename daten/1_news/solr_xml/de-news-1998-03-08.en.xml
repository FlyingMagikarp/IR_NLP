<field name="text">In statements on International Women's Day, women's organizations have appealed for equal opportunities, the right of self determination and more support for families. The President of the Women's Union, Bundestag (Lower House) Speaker Rita Suessmuth demanded a better day care system and higher child benefits. The German Minister for Women, Mrs. Nolte, said that human rights violations most frequently affect women. Violence against women is a violation of human rights. The Social Democrats' parliamentary party spokesperson on development, Mrs. Troescher, pointed out that women perform two thirds of the work hours worldwide but have only one tenth of the world's wealth at their disposal. Pro Asyl, a refugee organization, and the German Council for Women called for asylum legislation that takes into account persecution directed specifically at women.  </field>

<field name="text">The foreign policy of the Executive Board of Alliance 90 / The Greens was defeated yesterday. By a majority of just one vote, the party convention rejected a compromise formulation for the election program that stated that the deployment of the Bundeswehr (armed forces) in Bosnia has the character of a peace-keeping mission. This statement would have meant that the deployment in Bosnia was in agreement with the fundamentals of Green policy which supports peace-keeping missions, but rejects forcibly creating peace through military intervention. The Leader of the parliamentary Green party in the Bundestag, Mr. Fischer, criticized the Greens, saying that they make foreign policy unnecessarily hard for themselves. Mr. Fischer said that the decision sends out the wrong signal. He told journalists that this documents that his party is divided on an important issue of foreign policy. He added, however, that this has nothing to do with the ability of the Greens to participate in government. The Greens' financial expert, Mr. Metzger, said, he expects that this decision will cost the Greens up to two percent of the vote in the general election. The party convention yesterday also confirmed the demand to dissolve NATO, but rejected a unilateral withdrawal of Germany from the alliance. Today's discussions center around women's policies. The convention has renewed its demand for the abortion paragraph 218 to be removed from the penal code. Other subjects on the agenda will be interior security and questions of democracy. The three day conference will conclude this afternoon with a speech by the Chairman of the Executive Board, Mr. Trittin.  </field>

<field name="text">According to its Vice Chairman, Mr. Thierse, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) will ensure that there is reliable financial support for the new states if it wins the election in September. The reconstruction in the East cannot always be the first target for cutbacks, Mr. Thierse said in an interview with "Deutschlandfunk" radio. His party is aware that it is impossible to increase the level of support. The subventions must, however, be maintained at the present level and be more specifically targeted. Especially the industrial basis and small to medium companies should be supported. At the moment, too many ministries are involved. That creates too much disorganization, Mr. Thierse said.  </field>

<field name="text">North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister for Economy and Transport believes that the Social Democrat's program for the general election allows for a modern economic policy while at the same time aiming for social justice. Only the area of tax policy still has to be worked on, Mr. Clement said in an interview with "Sueddeutscher Rundfunk" radio. It is reasonable to consider a reintroduction of wealth tax if at the same time deductions in the highest tax brackets are significantly reduced. The experiences of the red-green coalition in North Rhine-Westphalia have shown that there have to be concrete coalition agreements with the Green Party on the issues of transport, energy and foreign policy. This can be concluded from the disagreement about brown coal mining in Gartzweiler II where no position was worked out in the coalition agreement.  </field>

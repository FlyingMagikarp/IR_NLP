<field name="text">A further 500 refugees from Kosovo have arrived on three flights in Leipzig, Munster and Berlin. More than half of the 10,000 refugees which Germany have agreed to accept will have arrived by Monday. In the meantime, the German Army is gradually running out of food and other aid for the refugees in the countries neighbouring Kosovo. The German public has been donating generously to funds set up for the refugees. The German Red Cross and Kap Anamur, the Emergency Doctor's Committee, have collected around 20 million marks. Many of the aid organisations have been working with sister organisations in Kosovo's neighbouring countries. Kap Anamur has received 13,2 million marks from 72,000 individual donators. Other organisations have also reported that German donators have been generous.  </field>

<field name="text">German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called on his party's leaders to provide him with clear support in his course of action for the Kosovo crisis. SPD leaders approved his application for the Kosovo operation at a special party conference held in Bonn. Mr. Schroeder spoke of a very serious discussion among the executive board of the party. However, he is counting on receiving majority support. Mr. Schroeder will probably also be elected as Oskar Lafontaine's successor as party leader at this conference.  </field>

<field name="text">According to information from the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper, renewed debate has broken out in the Green Party over Germany's participation in the war in Kosovo. The newspaper has quoted from a letter written by the parliamentary Greens in Bonn in which Angelika Beer, the party expert for military affairs, has criticised Joschka Fischer. She said that he held back information before the NATO attacks began. She writes that there had been a supplementary document to the Ramboillet Agreement limiting the sovereignty of Yugoslavia. Had the Greens known of this they would never have approved the Germany's participation. She continued that at this stage, she has no more patience for Mr. Fischer. Furthermore, he was apparently encouraging the spreading of the conflict. She said that those who compared the troops in Belgrade to the SS was saying that the goal of the operation should be to eliminate Milosevic and this would only be possible by employing ground forces.  </field>

<field name="text">Reported leaks in information before the start of the NATO operation in Kosovo have also caused a stir in SPD circles. Oskar Lafontaine, former leader of the party, said to the news magazine "Spiegel" that he had resigned because of insufficient prior information on the operation in the Balkans. Chancellor Schroeder had apparently told him about the failire of the Rambouillet talks over the telephone, demanding at the same time his support for German participation in the operation. The magazine quoted Mr. Lafontaine as saying that discussions on entering a war cannot be carried out over the telephone. Otto Schily, Minister for the Interior, has denied these accusations. He said to the ARD television station on Sunday evening that Mr. Lafontaine had been adequately involved and informed.  </field>

He said to the news magazine "Focus" that the CDU should be open to new arguments. He pleaded for laws to be passed for trial centres where addicts could shoot drugs. He said that such centres should no longer be a forbidden topic and that a more tolerant attitude towards drug addicts had thus been handicapped in Frankfurt and Hannover.  </field>

<field name="text">The right extremist party in the East German state of Thuringia, the National Party of Democracy (NPD), is apparently recruiting young skinheads and other right wingers to become members so as to improve the party's chances in the coming state elections in September. Mr. Roewer, president of the State's Department for Tutelage of the Constitution said to the magazine "Focus" that it has been observed that extremist right-wing groups have been practically "sucked" into the NPD.

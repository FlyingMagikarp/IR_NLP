<field name="text">Local elections are taking place in Schleswig-Holstein today. The provincial electoral office in Kiel said that voting had started quietly. 2.2 million voter will vote for city, district communal and communal parliaments. Very few young people had voted by Sunday afternoon. Sixteen-year-olds in Schleswig-Holstein were able to vote in local elections for the first time. In addition, around 30000 voters from other EU states were also entitled to vote in these elections. These elections are considered to be a test run for the national German elections in September. It is therefore of interest to see whether the SPD will be able to assert themselves as the strongest party three weeks after winning the state election in Lower Saxony. Four years ago the SPD achieved 39.5 percent of the vote, while the CDU attained only 37.5 percent.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr. Freitag, the chairman of the board for the Federal Social Insurance Office for Salaried Employees (BfA) has made some new suggestions regarding compulsory social insurance deductions for people employed under the 620 Mark basis. He used Austria as an example where small firms or private households do not have to deduct social insurance contributions for employees earning less than a certain income. However, large firms are prevented from splitting a full-time job over several part-time employees in order to avoid paying social insurance contributions. Mr. Freitag represents the Unions on the Board of the BfA.  </field>

<field name="text">Husstett, the spokeswoman on political environmental matters for the parliamentary fraction for the Greens, has contradicted statements made by Ms. Seibold, a party colleague, regarding the taxation of aeronautic diesel fuel. Ms. Husstett said that the diesel fuel tax was supported by the government, but that Germany could not act on its own regarding this tax. It would only make sense if it were introduced to the whole of Europe, she said. Ms. Seibold had said to the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" that the Green party would like to drastically increase the price of aeronautic diesel fuel to encourage holiday makers to use more environmentally friendly means of transport. She said that it was sufficient for Germans to fly overseas once every five years. Ms. Husstett contradicted this statement as well. She said that it has nothing to do with politicians where and when someone spends their holiday.  </field>

<field name="text">In Brussels, European Union heads of state and government concluded their discussions with UN Secretary-General Annan regarding a peace settlement for Kosovo. Chancellor Schroeder stressed the European leaders' support for the UN initiative and said they are striving for a corresponding resolution from the Security Council. It is now up to Belgrade to fulfill all conditions required by the international community. Germany, via its control of the EU Council presidency, is advocating a closer connection between the UN and Russia. According to French proposals, the Security Council could issue a mandate for an international peacekeeping force, and transfer the administration of Kosovo to the European Union. British Prime Minister Blair emphasized that the basis for any peace arrangement would have to be the five conditions that NATO has required of Yugoslavian President Milosevic. The Alliance as well as the US Government welcomed the German initiative, which among other things provides for a 24 hour ceasefire after Serbian forces begin to withdraw from Kosovo. The Yugoslavian President again rejected any international military presence in the region; PDS faction leader Gysi, who had spoken to President Milosevic in Belgrade, said only civilian observers would be considered. Similar statements were made by President Lukaschenko of Belarus.  </field>

<field name="text">Talks regarding an "Alliance for Work" cannot be conducted in isolation from wage policies, according to the president of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB), Schulte, speaking from Stuttgart. That would simply be out of the question, he said. For example he stressed, if retirement at age 60 or tariff funds were to be discussed, that would also involve a discussion of wage policies. Wage guidelines however, have no place in this discussion. The deputy chief of the IG-Metall union, Peter, also refused to talk about collective bargaining agreements in the context of the "Alliance for Work." In an interview with the magazine "Stern", he leveled specific criticism at employers, accusing them of preparing to abandon the Alliance.  </field>

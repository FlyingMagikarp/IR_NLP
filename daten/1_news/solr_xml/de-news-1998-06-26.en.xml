<field name="text">The Federal Environment Ministry has warned Hesse's state government against ordering a transport ban on radioactive fuel-elements. Any such decree would be against the law, according to a written statement by the federal ministry. The ministry's 10-point plan would already make sure no such transports could take place. And apart from that, ordering a ban on transports would be totally beyond the state of Hesse's competence  </field>

<field name="text">The row over the SPD's candidate for Minister of Economics, Mr Stollmann, continues. Mr Stollmann admitted that he had been a member of the CDU until 1986, but the fact had slipped his memory.  Mr Stollmann was criticised by the unions: deputy head of the Council of Trade Unions (DBG) Ms Engelen-Kefer, thought that Mr Stollmann's stand against a treaty for work was not acceptable: Mr Schroeder's team has to close ranks without any one member rocking the boat. The SPD's social expert, Mr Dressler, also was not too keen on Mr Stollmann becoming Minister of Economics.  </field>

<field name="text">Former PM of France, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, said there were grave deficiencies in German-French co-operation. He claimed, in an interview with the newspaper SAARBRUECKENER ZEITUNG, that mutual trust had gone out the door. Amongst other things this would have been due to growing German self-esteem. Germany would not rank friendship with France as high as they had used to in the past.  </field>

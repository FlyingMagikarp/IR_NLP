<field name="text"> Federal President Herzog has called for the Germans to develop a service culture.  The German people would have to learn to adjust to the wishes of customers and consumers.  If this were the case, the little employment miracle which occurred between 1984 and 1994 could recur.  During that time, the service economy created more than three million new jobs in the old federal states.  At the same time, Mr. Herzog calls for more courage to become independent on the part of the young people who are in vocational training. This would constitute a possible road out of unemployment which would simultaneously create new jobs.  Herzog asked all Germans to react to the challenges of the time with optimism, the readiness to take chances and mobility.  </field>

<field name="text"> According to a report in the Hamburg news magazine, DER SPIEGEL, the sorting sites for packing material waste with the "Green Dot" are the most dangerous places of employment in Germany.

The magazine refers to an unpublished study of the Federal Institute for the Protection of Workers and Workers' Medicine which is located in Berlin.  At the request of the Labor Ministry in Bonn, the agency will now examine blood samples from approximately 400 waste workers to ascertain whether their health has been affected.  </field>

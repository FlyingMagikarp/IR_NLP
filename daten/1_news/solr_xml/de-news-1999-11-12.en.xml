<field name="text">Foreign Minister Fischer said that Russia's attacks on Chechnya were a big mistake. During a joint press-conference with the EU's co-ordinator for foreign and security policies, Mr Solana, Mr Fischer also said that Russia would destabilise the whole Caucasian region. The Western countries would have to crank up political pressure on Moscow, though he was against economic sanctions. Previously Germany and Great Britain had agreed on a paper requiring negotiations about the conflict. The paper also stipulates that Russia has to comply with international law and OSZE-rules. Russia's Foreign Minister Ivanov had spoken to Mr Solana and launched a OSZE-observer mission in Chechnya.  </field>

<field name="text">Tonight tens of thousands of Austrians demonstrated against right-wing populist Haider. According to police sources, some 30,000 people had gathered in Vienna's city center pushing their slogan "no coalition with racism". In the afternoon, Mr Haider had said he was sorry about his contentious declarations about national socialism. During a meeting of the Free Party of Austria (Freiheitliche Partei Oesterreichs, FPOE) Mr Haider stated that what he had said had been insensitive and easily misunderstood. The FPOE had come in second at last October's federal elections  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder thinks that parliament's passing a part of his cost-cutting measures strengthened the coalition. Now government has saved 26 billion marks, and there is no need for the consent of the Upper House (Bundesrat), and this also covers the contentious plan to reform pensions. The Upper House (Bundesrat) will only need to look at another 4 billion marks to be cut. Parliament also passed laws modifying existing laws on how families are treated taxwise: allowances and tax-exemptions will rise.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Environment Minister Trittin defended the ecological tax against criticism in the North-Rhine/Westphalia SPD. He said that tax-exemptions for very efficient gas-fired powerplants wouldn't kill any jobs that weren't about to be lost anyway. North-Rhine/Westphalia's Premier Clement had announced that he would vote against the law (in the Upper House (Bundesrat)), as it would be bad for coalmining. State head of the SPD party Muentefering, however, said in an interview with the KOELNER STADTANZEIGER, that mining of lignite (brown coal) would not suffer.  </field>

<field name="text">Parliament passed a law amending the rules about non-genuine contracting - when people who work like employees get paid as contractors. How to determine who is an employee and who isn't, will change, and the burden of proof will be shifted to Social Security, to a large extent. Excessive retroactive demands for contributions will be ruled out, and there will be more chances for self-employed people to be exempt from contributions. The contentious law had been in force since January. The amendments had been proposed by a commission of experts  </field></doc></add>

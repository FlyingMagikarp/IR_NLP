<field name="text">Last night in Helsinki, Russia and the United States worked out the details of a how to set up a unified KFOR command.  With that, they overcame the last big obstacle to a peaceful occupation of Kosovo. Russia was not able to push through its plan to get its own sector in the south Serbian province.  The Pristina airport that Russian soldiers occupied in a surprise move will henceforth be available for the use of all participating countries.  Until now, Russians had blocked other KFOR contingents from using the airport.  The withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo is mostly running according to plan. The second stage of the withdrawal ended at midnight, and as far as NATO can judge, Serbian troops have left the eastern and western parts of Kosovo as agreed.  The third and last stage, which will complete the pull out, lasts through tomorrow evening.  The disarmament of the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has been a problem, but German officers and KLA commanders reached an agreement yesterday. Starting today, Albanian fighters are supposed to stop carrying weapons in public in German controlled zones.  Starting Sunday, they are supposed to stop wearing uniforms in public.  Thus today has become an important test.  This is all taking place against the background of mass migrations people that started days ago and are still going on.  Serbs are fleeing in huge numbers out of Kosovo while Albanians are returning in the tens of thousands.  Aid organizations have strained to the limit.  Every day the same terrible picture is repeated, as returning Albanians find destroyed houses, ruined farms, and learn of relatives that have been mistreated or killed by the Serbs.  In Pec, in western Kosovo, KLA fighters led Italian KFOR soldiers to a torture chamber housed in a police station, similar to one found in Pristina.  The KLA said several hundred Albanians were dragged here.  Their subsequent fate is unknown.  </field>

<field name="text">The leaders of the of the seven biggest industrialized countries plus Russia continued their world economic summit in Cologne.  Yesterday they agreed on a debt forgiveness package for the world's poorest countries. Officially the summit didn't begin until this morning when representatives from the US, Canada, Russia, Japan, France, Great Britain and Italy were greeted by Chancellor Schroeder. The heads of state posed for pictures on the bank of the Rhine and then headed off for their second working meeting.  The conflict in Kosovo was again a theme of discussion.  The main question is how the stability pact for the Balkans will be set up and how the costs for the reconstruction of Kosovo will be divided. Yesterday the G8 countries unanimously approved the agreement reached by the US and Russia over the role Russian troops would play in KFOR. Clinton said a good day's work had been accomplished.  Chancellor Schroeder assured the states bordering Yugoslavia that they will get humanitarian help.  In the case of Serbia, however, he made help conditional on democratization.  Around the edges of the second day's summit activities could be seen two demonstrations, which were expected to attract up to 70,000 people total. The high point was a human chain in which an estimated 50,000 people participated.  They called for complete debt forgiveness for the world's poorest countries.  The G-7's agreement yesterday agreed to strike 40% of the debt.  </field>

<field name="text">The Labor Minister, Walter Riester, said that under certain circumstances he was ready to waive the hotly-contested right to private pensions.

<field name="text">The news agency dpa reported that sources inside the coalition said that Juergen Tritten, Minister of the Environment, had just barely managed to avoid being dismissed by Chancellor Schroeder.

<field name="text">Economics Minister Werner Mueller has apparently come to an agreement with the power companies on key points of the plan to end the use of nuclear power.  On this latest view, the last nuclear power plant will be unplugged from the grid in 25 years.  The government and the Chairmen of the boards of directors of the power concerns are supposed to meet and discuss these key points in the Chancellor's office on Tuesday.  But the RWE corporation said that it was too soon to speak of an "agreement" about ending the use of nuclear power, and a spokesman for Viag said that he didn't know of any understanding having been reached.  </field>

<field name="text">Politicians and Catholic laity have appealed to the Bishop for the church to continue counseling pregnant women [about whether or not to have an abortion].  Dr. Christine Bergmann, the Family Minister, said that even in the event that the Catholic church does pull out, the existing law requiring counseling should be kept.  Pope John Paul II called on the Bishop by letter to end such counseling. [The Pope thinks such counseling gives the impression that the Church considers abortion an option that merits discussion.]  </field>

<field name="text">Wolfgang Clement (SPD), the minister president of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Hans-Jochen Vogel, former head of the SPD, have both voiced harsh criticism of the way the federal government is being managed.  Mr. Vogel spoke of professional short-comings in the red-green coalition. He took issue with the fact that many laws are criticized from the party's own ranks just after they have been adopted. He finds this difficult to understand at times.  Clement lamented the government's inability to communicate with the people on upcoming reforms. He added that essential measures have to be formulated in such a way that ordinary citizens can understand.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl and the out-going president of the European Union, Luxembourg's Prime Minister Junker, are urging Germans to see globalization and the unification of Europe as a budding opportunity. Rather than always just complaining, Germany must step into the third millennium full of realistic optimism, as Kohl said at a "Europe convention" held by the CDU/CSU parliamentary group. He added that an economically splintered Europe would not stand a chance in international competition in the long run.  </field>

<field name="text">The RWE energy company intends to sue the state of Rhineland-Palatinate for damages because of errors in the permit which the state issued the company to operate the Muehlhiem-Kaerlich nuclear power plant. RWE board member, Hlubek, in an interview with the newspaper "Die Welt", spoke of a sum of DM 9 billion. On Suedwestfunk radio this evening, Hlubek said the plant would now most likely be torn down; some equipment would be sold; and reconstruction would take ten years. According to the Suedwestfunk, the cost of dismantling the plant would run in at DM 1 billion. The Federal Administrative Court in Berlin ruled this morning that the nuclear power plant could not be brought into operation again because it was not earthquake-proof.  </field>

<field name="text">At a Special Sitting of the Bundestag in Bonn today, the Opposition criticized Internal Affairs Minister Kanther's attitude on refugee policies. SPD internal affairs critic, Koerper, accused Kanther of generating an atmosphere of hysteria by speaking as he has of a mass influx of Kurds into Europe. Koerper added that it was not particularly helpful to point the finger of blame at the Italian government either. A Green Bundestag member, Dietert-Scheuer (sp?), said the minister was agitating for malicious policies aimed at completely sealing Europe's borders. Kanther defended his views and pointed to the increasing numbers of Kurdish refugee claimants, saying that the threat posed by such a flood was alarming.  </field>

<field name="text">The city of Hamburg wants to charge landing fees commensurate with aircraft exhaust emissions at its Fuhlsbuettel airport in the future. The City Parliament unanimously approved the motion by the Greens/Alternative List. The plan must still be approved by the Hamburg Economic Authority, which sets the take-off and landing charges. If it agrees, Fuhlsbuettel will become the first airport in Germany to tie landing fees to emission levels.  </field>

<field name="text">Almost two years after the ban on the export of British beef was imposed, London can hope for the restrictions to be eased. The EU Commission has suggested that beef exports from Northern Ireland be permitted, under certain conditions. The animals would have to come from herds in which there has been no case of mad cow disease in the last few years; that information would be kept track of by computer. EU Agricultural Commissioner Fischler has not named a date for the implementation of the suggested new regulations; the other members of the EU must agree to the idea first.  </field>

<field name="text">An investigation committee reporting to the Bundestag began its investigation of extreme right-wing activities in the German armed forces today. It is the Defence Committee which has been entrusted with this job. Participants decided not to restrict the investigation to formally documented occurrences of right-wing or anti-foreigner acts, but rather to include also the current conditions within the armed forces and the attitudes of the soldiers. This expanded mandate had been demanded by the SPD and the Greens. It is not yet clear who will be called to testify. Hearings are set to begin on February 4.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bundestag's health committee has not issued a position in the battle over a law to protect non-smokers. The chairman of the committee, Thomae (FDP), issued a statement following the committee's final meeting, to the effect that members of the Bundestag should vote according to their conscience, without any outside influence. At issue is a joint motion by 125 representatives from the Government and the Opposition to ban smoking in businesses and public spaces. The Hartmannbund doctors' association told the "Berliner Kurier" newspaper that it was against excessive regulation in this regard.  </field>

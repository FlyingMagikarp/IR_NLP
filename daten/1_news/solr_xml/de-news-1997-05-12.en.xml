<field name="text">The wage comittee of the 'Bau-Steine-Erden' union rejected the arbitration proposal by a large majority. The committee will not accept the cuts in sick-pay. According to the arbitration, sick-pay for construction workers would be reduced to 80% of the salary during the first three weeks of sick-leave. The construction workers insist on 100%. The union is still willing to compromise, at least until the period of declaration ends on May 21 at 4 pm CEDT. Specifically, the union offered the employers further negotiations about the sick-pay. In addition, it is willing to accept cuts in details of the current wage contract as a compensation. However, Wieshuegel confirmed that walkouts are inevitable, if an understanding can not be achieved.  The associations of the construction industry will consult about the compromise proposal on Tuesday and Wednesday. In response to the decline from the union they said a strike would be a disaster for the construction industry which is already hit hard by the recession. Foreign subcontractors would be the only winners with their low-paid workers from all over Europe, snapping contracts from the German construction industry.  </field>

Bluem rejected the accusation that the coalition wanted to cut pensions. Instead, the goal is to reduce the annual increase rate about an average of 0.4%.  </field>

<field name="text">The SPD declined separate negotiations with the government about the pension reform. In parliament the SPD is willing to negotiate, but to party leader Lafontaine separate talks make no sense. Lafontaine himself is prepared for private talks with Minister of Labor Bluem about this topic. Bluem indicated that he would dispense with the planned reduction of pensions if the SPD was willing to talk. Fundamentally, Lafontaine said, his party is going to talk about all proposals, provided that the pensions will not be reduced to the level of social welfare assistance. Lafontaine asked the governing coalition to deliver concrete proposals and to put a bill for discussion in the parliament. The SPD plans to create a bill concerning the pension reform itself after the summer vacation. FDP leader Gerhard sees no alternatives to the pension plans of the coalition: It is more honest to tell the pensioners that their pensions will rise more slowly than to create new charges by hurrying to redistribute finances.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Minister of Labor Bluem blistered the SPD's refusal to negotiate the pension reform, saying the party was trying to get out of the shared responsibility. He said that this attitude was a novelty in  post-war history and bad for the pension insurance. SPD party leader Lafontaine had previously declined separate negotiations about the planned pension reform with the coalition. On the other side, Lafontaine reproached the coalition for leaving the compromise about pensions without consultations with the SPD last week.  </field>

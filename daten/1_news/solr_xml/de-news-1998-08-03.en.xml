<field name="text">The plan of SPD candidate for Chancellor Schroeder to stop using atomic energy as fast possible caused heavy reactions. The Minister of Economics, Rexrodt (FDP) accused Schroeder of preparing the German economy to leave the technological world league. Additio0nally, he would endanger 40.000 highly qualified jobs . The Minister of Research, Ruettgers (CDU) said that after shutting down German nuclear power plants, atomic energy would have to be imported from France or Eastern Europe. The Greens welcomed Schroeder's plan. They consider it an interesting starting point for negotiations with the SPD on energy policy. It was announced this weekend that if Schroeder wins the elections, he plans to shut down the six oldest German nuclear power plants. For the rest of the nuclear power plants, a phasing-out timetable should be set up.  </field>

The Minister of Economics, Farnleitner, ordered new acoustic measurements for next night. Two other bubbles are surmised to exist in the tunnel system.

<field name="text">The President of the Federal Labour Office, Jagoda, is more pessimistic on the development of the labour market then Chancellor Kohl. Jagoda said to the Leipziger Volkszeitung that in discord with the Bonn coalition he does not expect the number of unemployed to decrease below the 4-million level in the fall. Jagoda said he would be quit happy should Kohl's forecast prove true. But in his experience a slight increase in the number of unemployed might be expected for the summer months. As to the question of a turning-point in the labour market, Jagoda also has a different opinion than the federal government. He emphasised that a real turning-point would be reached when the unemployment rate is lower than the year before for three months in a row. Just now, this occurs in Western Germany only.  </field>

<field name="text">Lower Saxony's Minister of the Interior, Glogowski, does not see the border guards growing into a federal police force, despite their widened authority. Talking to Deutschlandradio Berlin, the SPD minister said the new scope of authority of the border guards concerning the federal railway was reasonable. Furthermore, this scope of authority would be naturally limited by space and occasion. Nobody will have to be afraid of this widened authority being a step in the direction of establishing a federal police force.  </field>

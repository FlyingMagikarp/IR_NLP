<field name="text">The CDU executive board has convened tonight in Bonn for a special meeting to discuss the planned overhaul of the pension plans.  The reform is based on a proposal written by an expert panel under the leadership of Labor Minister Bluem. One point was to gradually reduce pension payments from 70% to 64% of the after-tax salaries, by the year 2030. The premiums would have to be increased to almost 23% over the same period of time. Child benefits and pension claims from years of unemployment due to upbringing of children should be separated from the general pension funds and be financed through a special family plan yet to be created from tax revenue. The FDP, but also parts of CDU/CSU, met the proposal with fierce criticism. The CDU pension commission announced to present its own bill on Monday.  </field>

<field name="text">The preparations for the relocation of the Parliament to Berlin in 1999 are proceeding on budget and on schedule, according to the Coalition and the SPD. In a topical debate in Parliament held at the request of Alliance 90/The Greens, speakers of CDU/CSU and SPD jointly rejected the accusation that the relocation was too expensive. The Parliament building in Berlin is not one of luxury but one of dignity and adequacy, the head of the construction commission, Mr. Kansi (CDU) pointed out. The representative of The Greens, Ms. Alstett-Boehlich, demanded that the cost volume of 20 billion DM be reduced by at least 2 billion DM. In particular at times when a majority of the population has to bear severe austerity measures, she said, it is unacceptable for the government to preach water while drinking wine itself.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bundestag's approval of the German-Czech declaration of reconciliation has been welcomed by the government in Prague. Czech Foreign Minister Mr. Zieleniec views the broad majority of the declaration as a positive sign. The vote shows, he went on, that for the most part, the political spectrum of Germany has internalized that today's relations with the Czech republic are no longer burdened by the past and that current efforts can now be focused on the future. The German Parliament's decision is at the same time an inducement for the Czech legislators to ratify the declaration as well, Mr. Zieleniec concluded. The Czech President Mr. Havel called Bonn's decision an important step towards establishing good relations between the nations of Europe. The President of the Parliament in Prague, Mr. Seman, however, voiced his disappointment about the fact that the SPD addendum to the declaration failed. The chairman of the Czech social democratic party - a party of the Opposition - said the vote made clear which of the German parties show understanding for Czech interests. The SPD addition had called for a clear commitment to not burden the relations with political and legal questions of the past. This issue had arisen before the background of claims by Sudeten Germans.  </field>

<field name="text">For decades, Nazi war criminals have received federal victim pension in Germany. The Federal Welfare Ministry confirmed a corresponding reportage by the ARD TV magazine "Panorama". According to the Federal Provision Law of 1950, everybody who had suffered damage, mostly injuries, during the war is entitled to so-called victim pension, regardless of whether the recipient was involved in crimes committed by the Nazi regime. Last year alone, the victim pension, paid to more than one million citizens, had a total volume of 13 billion DM. FDP lawmakers have demanded new legislation barring Nazi war criminals from eligibility for victim pension.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Transportation Minister Wissmann considers the construction of the Transrapid [high speed levitation train] vital for its marketability abroad. The Transrapid project increases the chances for exports of German high technology products, Wissmann (CDU) said in Bonn. He conceded, however, that as of now there is little foreign demand for the magnetic levitation train. The planned route runs between Hamburg and Berlin. The project's future is dim due to uncertain funding. SPD and The Greens oppose the construction.  </field>

<field name="text">In the reform of the civil service code, the demand by SPD-led states to employ civil servants on a part time basis even if that is against their will, remained a point of controversy until the end. Minister Kanther of the Interior categorically opposed this suggestion. The solution that was found leaves it up to the discretion of the states to employ entry-level civil servants part-time or full-time. This entails that all regulations governing part-time employment of civil servants now fall under the jurisdiction of the states, as opposed to the federal government. This consensus by the mediation committee being achieved, it is now expected that the reform of the civil service code will find final approval in Bundestag and Bundesrat. Once the new code becomes effective, civil servants will have a performance-oriented pay scale. In particular, young officials that work diligently can achieve promotions more quickly. Moreover, top positions are assigned non-permanently. Reassignments are now possible without the consent of the individual.  </field>

<field name="text">In the latest BSE-case more and more signs indicate manipulation. The registration number of the cow has also been found on two other Galloway-cows at different breeders, as was stated by the Minister of Agriculture, Borchert, in an interrview. The number was also used for a British import-cow. All numbers were written on the documents in pencil and it is therefore impossible to track the origin and real name of the cows.  </field>

On Deutschlandradio Berlin, Mr. Phillip warned against the negative effects this would have on trade.

Mr. Phillips rejected remarks by the FDP economics spokesman Mr. Friedhoff who demanded a comprehensive overhaul of the system of industry-wide collective bargaining agreements.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Public Services and Transport Union (OeTV) seems to insist on considerable raises during the wage negotiations in the field of passenger and freight traffic. A spokesman of the union mentioned a raise of an average three to five percent. The negotiations for the 550,000 employees will take place in about 30 separate districts. The OeTV also aims for a continued 100% payment to sick workers, a rapid adjustment of East-German salaries to West-German standards, and an improvement of industrial safety. By virtue of the fact that there exists an essential wage differential between public and private employers, the OeTV would like to get an area wage agreement accepted. The negotiations are supposed to begin next week.  </field>

<field name="text">Lower Saxony's Secretary of the Interior Glogowski obviously doubted the security of the castor transport in the up-coming week. DER SPIEGEL reports that Glogowski asked his fellow secretaries in other German states to send at least 2,100 more police officers to Lower Saxony. Otherwise he would not be able to guarantee that the transport would be carried out in an orderly manner.  Police officials made known, however, that the support of additional police was already confirmed. It is not known how many police officers and members of the Federal Border Guard will be brought into action. But there are estimates that a total of almost 19,000 officers throughout the Federal Republic are supposed to protect the transport of the castor container. Lower Saxony approved the storage of six radioactive waste containers in the intermediate storage facility in Gorleben last Friday.  </field>

<field name="text">SPD and CDU/CSU want to begin a discussion of the tax reform on Monday. Schaeuble added that these talks will be continued if they are successful. Then, it might be possible to discuss many issues. SPD floor leader Scharping, however, put a damper on any hopes of quickly reaching an agreement with the CDU/CSU. He told the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINEN SONNTAGSZEITUNG that he is very skeptical of the coalition's ability to achieve a solution. Furthermore, Scharping told the FRANFURTER RUNDSCHAU that the SPD will never agree on a taxation of extra payments to shift workers. The SPD will also refuse to discuss any infringement on the old-age pension and life insurance system.  </field>

<field name="text">The chairman of the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), Mr, Engelhardt suggested that a common appeal of the Catholic and Protestant Church should strengthen social consensus in Germany. During an interview with the radio station DEUTSCHLANDFUNK, he mentioned that this social consensus might disappear if individual groups were only aware of their singular interests. He also argued in favor of more individual responsibility but warned of an elbowing mentality. Society would be destroyed if it were not supported by all social groups. At this point, he renewed the claim of the Protestant Church that stronger shoulders have to carry the heavier burden. In Hannover today, the Council of the Protestant Church approved the common appeal of the churches. Engelhardt and Chairman of the Catholic Bishops' Conference Lehmann will meet for a talk on Sunday afternoon.  </field>

<field name="text">Several thousand persons demonstrated against right-wing violence two weeks after the killing of a young punk in Magdeburg. The police reported about 2,000 participants while the organizers estimated that almost 4,000 persons participated--most of them members of the left and autonomous political spectrum. More than 1,000 police officers and members of the Federal Border Guard controlled the area around Magdeburg prior to the demonstration to prevent the arrival of demonstrators who might have been willing to use force. An anti-fascist alliance initiated the rally which was supported by the government of Saxony-Anhalt, the parliamentary factions of SPD and PDS as well as the city of Magdeburg. The reason for the demonstration was the killing of a 17 year old punk two weeks ago. Last Thursday the police arrested a 17 year old right-wing teenager. In the meantime, he has confessed that he committed the crime alone.  </field>

<field name="text">The stability council for the European Monetary Union called for by France should have only informal functions according to EU-Commission President Santer. In no case should the formation of such a political body lessen the independence of the European Central Bank, Santer stated today at a small state party meeting of the CDU of Baden-Wuerttemberg in Buehl. Representatives of the federal government as well as those of other EU- countries also expressed their reservations about creating a stability council. At this meeting, the CDU of Baden-Wuerttemberg emphatically favored starting the European Monetary Union in 1999. The Southwest-CDU issued a lead motion which warns against trade wars and job losses if the historical opportunity for a currency union is lost.  </field>

<field name="text">A bible from the days of Luther that was discovered two years ago in Stuttgart apparently did not belong to the reformer. Experts declared after a three-day conference in Stuttgart's state library that this bible was not written by Martin Luther himself. The handwriting coincided with Luther's but represented merely  the typical penmanship of those days. The writer of that bible might have lived in Saxony where he could have had access to Luther's original manuscripts. They concluded that the hypothesis that Luther used this bible when he translated the New Testament at the Wartburg was definitely untenable.  </field>

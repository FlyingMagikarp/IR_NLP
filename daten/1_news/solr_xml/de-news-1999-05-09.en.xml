<field name="text">NATO places the blame for the attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on faulty intelligence. A NATO spokesman in Brussels said that the embassy was thought to be a Yugoslavian army building. The intelligence was used by the military to program the missile guidance systems. CIA director Mr. Tenet and American Defense Minister William Cohen have both officially acknowledged the mistake. They also stated that this was an anomaly that would be unlikely to occur again. Furthermore, NATO has apologized for the attack once more. The Chinese embassy in Belgrade was bombed and destroyed overnight on Saturday. Four people died and several were injured.  About 100 people protested in the Chinese capital in front of the German embassy. The demonstration was peaceful with participants demanding an end to the NATO air raids in Yugoslavia. Tens of thousands of people yesterday [Saturday] protested in front of the US embassy and consulate buildings. Fire bombs were thrown into the embassy compound. A spokesman for the US embassy said that it is a siege-like situation. The embassy and four US consulates have been closed for the time being. The Beijing government has been supporting the protests in front of Western embassies since the NATO attack on the Chinese delegation in Belgrade.  </field>

<field name="text">The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) has officially nominated Uta Ranke-Heinemann, a theologian from Essen who is not affiliated with a political party, as their candidate for the German presidency. At a national convention, PDS representatives chose the 71-year-old daughter of former President Gustav Heinemann in an open election with few abstentions. However, in the election in two weeks only the SPD and Christian Democratic Union (CDU) candidates Johannes Rau and Dagmar Schipanski are expected to have a serious chance of becoming the successor to President Roman Herzog. The PDS only has 65 out of 1338 votes. Ms. Ranke-Heinemann lost her professorship in Essen after a dispute with the Catholic Church in 1987. The theologian is engaged in the peace movement and was the first woman to become a professor of Catholic theology. PDS president Gregor Gysi said that both Ms. Ranke-Heinemann and the party hope to use this candidacy to protest the war in Kosovo.  </field>

<field name="text">The Council of German Chambers of Commerce forecasts that the implementation of the new regulations on 630 mark jobs will 800,000 jobs. They further predict that only a small portion of these lost jobs will be replaced by other employment opportunities. Mr. Riester, Minister of Labor on the other hand, stresses that of the 5,6 million employees with 630 mark jobs, 4,2 million will be better off when they become eligible to receive a pension. According to Mr. Riester, these laws will test the willingness of the governing coalition to implement reform. The Minister also said that if this abuse is not stopped, the future of the social security system as a whole is in danger.  </field>

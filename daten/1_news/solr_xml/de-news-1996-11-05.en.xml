<field name="text">RAF terrorist Birgit Hogefeld has been sentenced to life in prison for murder. The Frankfurt Higher Regional Court found the 40-year old woman responsible for the death of three people. The judges were convinced that Hogefeld participated in the bomb attack on the U.S. air base at the Frankfurt airport in 1985. A young GI was murdered the day before the attack, which the RAF cynically justified by saying they needed his I.D. to access the grounds the following day. The court also found that the terrorist was involved in the failed attack on Tietmeyer, the current president of the Central Bank. Hogefeld was acquitted of the June 1993 murder of a GSG 9 official in the Bad Kleinen train station. Overall, the judges found the guilt particularly severe, which means the sentence will not be automatically reviewed after 15 years. The defense said they would appeal.  </field>

<field name="text">The coalition parties still have not reached agreement in the tax debate. The party and faction leaders of the CDU, CSU and FDPdebated the financing of the 1997 budget and tax issues such as the solidarity surcharge for three hours this morning in the Chancellor s Office. They then recessed until this evening. The Union and FDP expressed assurance that the coalition was not in danger. The FDP insists that the solidarity surcharge decrease by two percentage points in 1998. Since the Union rejected this proposal just yesterday, a final solution is not expected today. No progress was made in the debates on the 1997 federal budget, either. Actual spending cuts will be discussed at the end of the week when the next tax estimates become available. Scharping, head of the SPD, also demanded that Kohl make the fiscal policy clearer. He demanded a clear legal decision to decrease the solidarity surcharge. Sharping also called the federal budget unconstitutional again due to the large deficit.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Chancellor Kohl received Turkish President Demirel today for an exchange of ideas. Demirel also met with representatives of the opposition and Schmalz-Jacob, the federal government s commissioner for foreigners. No details are known at this time. Human rights and the Kurdish question are central political topics of the official four-day visit by the Turkish head of state. Just yesterday President Herzog demanded that Ankara recognize human rights. This, more than anything, according to Herzog, is the prerequisite for Turkey s increased involvement in Europe. Foreign Minister Kinkel, who will meet with Demirel tomorrow, also expressed his support for reinstating the payments from the European Union which were blocked due to Ankara s Kurdish policy. In a newspaper interview, Kinkel stated that the agreement was reached under difficult conditions and should now be fulfilled. Hundreds of Kurds demonstrated that morning in the Bonn government district against Turkey s persecution of their people.  The Greens and the PDS appealed to the federal government to halt all military and police support for Ankara. In an official announcement, Turkey declared that they are a laicistic, democratic state with a market economy.  Demirel also explained that Turkey respects human rights and wants to practice them.  With regard for the Kurds, who are fighting for their souvereignty, he added, however, that his country must and will combat separatist tendencies.  </field>

<field name="text">Per a basic agreement reached between the Post Office and the Post Office Bank, the Post Office may close 4,500 of their 16,500 branches over the next three years. After the year 2000, the Post Office may close another 2,000 branches. Mr. Boetsch, the acting Postal Minister, protested that this means that the specifications that the nearest post office be located no more than 2 kilometers away will not be met. According to the German Postal Workers  Union, the agreement puts more  than 20,000 jobs on the block. Union leader van Harn criticized this as unacceptable and warned the parties responsible against a social powder keg. After an 18-month debate, the Post Office and the Post Office Bank signed a teller window usage agreement yesterday.  According to the details which were revealed today, the Post Office Bank will pay the Post Office 1.1 billion marks next year for the use of their teller windows. The fee decreases in subsequent years. The Post Office had originally requested 1.4 billion marks.  To make up for the difference, the Post Office will receive 25% of shares in the Post Office Bank. The FDP objects to this, because it would give the Post Office too much influence on the bank.  Liberals are therefore calling for additional talks.  The price of stamps will increase in April, to 1.10 marks for a letter and one mark for post cards.  </field>

<field name="text">Married couples with children will fare considerably better with their taxes due to several rulings by the Federal Constitutional Court. According to one decision by the Court, the state is obligated for the first time to recognise the job of raising children within a marriage. Beginning next year, the tax exemption will be increased in two stages; for example, for a married couple with one child 9,500 DM per year. Up to now, only single people or permanently separated parents received this advantage. The governing coalition as well as the opposition welcomed the Constitutional Court's decision as a strengthening of the family. Federal Family Minister Christine Bergmann announced that the government would implement the ruling as soon as possible. Federal Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine calculated the loss of tax revenue at over 22 billion DM. However, Lafontaine also welcomed the ruling, saying that the SPD had always thought that families should be accorded more support. He added that adjustments would have to be made in the budget to offset possible losses. The Deputy Chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Friedrich Merz, called on the government to present a budget reflecting these tax changes. He said the previous proposal made by the SPD and the Greens was now invalid.  </field>

<field name="text">Spouses who supplement the family income with a so-called 630-Mark job will not have to pay taxes on this amount according to a report in the "Hannoverschen Allgemeinen Zeitung." The newspaper obtained its information from sources within coalition circles. According their sources, the reform of the 630-Mark jobs, which the SPD and the Greens plan to present to the Bundestag on Friday, will contain this provision. The tax exemption is justified by the fact that "casual jobs" act as a bridge to the labor market. The report has meanwhile been confirmed by members of the coalition in Bonn.  </field>

<field name="text">Bundestag Vice-president Rudolf Seiters (CDU/CSU) called on the federal government to compromise on the reform of the citizenship law in the interest of domestic peace as well as of the foreigners living in the country. In a newspaper interview, Seiters said he believed it was possible, within a multilateral framework, to come to an agreement on regulations for minor children of foreigners. All social groups should take part in the discussion in a responsible manner, said Seiters. Then an acceptable agreement could be reached as it was in the compromise on the asylum law in 1993.  </field>

<field name="text">The industrial trade union for construction, agriculture and the environment (IG BAU) is entering collective bargaining for the 1.1 million employees of the construction industry without a specific demand for wage increases. Union president Klaus Wiesenhuegel said in Frankfurt that allocation latitude should be utilised for a collective wage agreement that is secure for the long-term. It is important to the union to prevent poverty among its retired members, to reduce unemployment as well as to improve the incomes of its members. Among other things, the union wants to have an additional pension included in the agreement. The employers welcomed the union's relinquishing of a percentage increase; in this way essential issues could be addressed more easily.  </field>

<field name="text">There was more bickering within the governing coalition parties about possible tax-hikes, and Mr Waigel did not rule them out before the elections, stating that they would only take place if other taxes were lowered at the same time. He also warned the FDP against attacking him any more in his role as Finance Minister. If the Liberals jeopardised the coalition, this would lead to their own demise. Yesterday Mr Lambsdorff, the FDP-spokes-person for economic affairs, had predicted that the Bonn coalition would come to an end in case the CDU/CSU insisted on higher taxes.  </field>

<field name="text">SPD-social policy expert Dressler strongly criticised Bonn's plans to ease the unemployment- and superannuation-insurances' burden by dipping into the old-age health insurance's funds, robbing Peter to pay Paul. They had all agreed that any monies accumulated in the old-age sector were meant for a rainy day. And apart from that, he would not trust government's assertions that this was only a temporary measure and they would put the money back later.:::Famous precedent: the so-called 'Juliusturm', a hoard that started to accumulate under Chancellor Adenauer, earmarked for expenses to do with the re-unification of Germany. At the time, all political parties were quite happy to use it for other purposes:::  </field>

<field name="text">Frankfurt on Main. One worker was injured during a chemical accident at Hoechst's Frankfurt plant when 500 kilogrammes of heat-absorbing oil leaked from a machine. According to the company, the man's lower arm was scalded, but there had been no danger to the environment, according to the Fire Service. As there was a cloud of smoke near the site, they asked the general population to keep doors and windows closed to keep out fumes.  </field>

<field name="text">Nothing moved on the front between award negotiators as far as the dispute about fully paid sick-leave in the metal-industry was concerned. Mr Zambelli, of the union, said they would not talk about reducing pay or holiday-entitlements in case of sick-leave. Mr Hund, spokes-person of the employers, thought that reducing holiday-entitlements for paid sick-leave was socially acceptable. Negotiations about the whole package-deal are still continuing in Karlsruhe.:::So far employers keep paying 100% of your wage every time you're on sick-leave, for a limited period, and you do not have to use up your annual leave entitlement instead. Germany never had a system where you had a set number of (cumulating) paid sick-days/year, like many Anglo-Saxon countries:::  </field>

<field name="text">Baden-Wuerttemberg premier Teufel spoke out for lowering subsidies for the mining of bituminous coal, stating that 10 billion marks/year were not warranted. The money should be invested in technologies of the future, instead of trying to keep obsolete industries afloat. He proposed lowering them by 500 million marks/year. As of 2005, 2 billion marks should be enough to keep Germany's leading edge in the area of mining technology.:::There is no coal-mining in Baden-Wuerttemberg, yet quite a few high-tech companies, including Mercedes:::  </field>

<field name="text">In the future, public health insurers will not be allowed to pay for drugs other than pharmacy-only and prescription drugs, according to a report by the tabloid BILD, who referred to draft-legislation for the third stage of health-reforms, thus effectively excluding drugs available in health-shops and supermarkets. And there were to be more cuts to anything to do with tooth-replacement.:::GPs give the prescription-form to the patient, they hand it in at the local pharmacy, and the latter get re-imbursed by the health insurer. It will be up to the GP to make sure no-one's going to be out of pocket.:::  </field>

<field name="text">The controversy between Hesse's government and Bonn's ministry for the environment about the moth-balling of nuclear power-pant Biblis, entered another round. Hesse's minister Nimsch, of the Greens Party, said she would revoke the 1975 permit for part A because of grave safety concerns. Experts had found that the 20-year old nuclear power-plant's safety could not be be brought up to standard within the foreseeable future, and therefore the plant had to be moth-balled. So far Hesse's government had used injunctions, that subsequently had to be withdrawn, at the behest of the federal ministry.  </field>

<field name="text">The union strongly criticised Baden-Wuerttemberg's proposal to charge fees for ancillary classes at Elementary Schools, as of next school-year, claiming that this would pave the way to general tuition-fees. If parents were unable to pay up, they would have to enrol their children for the standard classes at Elementary School, and that would not make sense, as children could not be supported according to their needs. According to the education minister, fees are to be approx. 80 marks/month, about as much as parents pay for kindergarten.  </field>

AC Monaco had previously defeated Borussia Moenchengladbach, virtually kicking them out of the UEFA-Cup. Karlsruhe and Schalke have an easier job: the KSC will play Denmark's Broenby, in Denmark, and Schalke Belgium's FC Bruegge, in Belgium.  </field>

<field name="text">Yesterday some readers received more than 1 electronic copy of GermNews, that's the German edition. We regret this has happened, but are unable to guarantee it won't happen again in the future. Here is why: though we dispatch only 1 copy per reader, glitches in the transmission process around the globe often fool transmitting computers into believing, that their mail hasn't been accepted (yet), and, for safety's sake, and after a short delay, re-transmit it. These problems are usually sorted out quickly, so you should get your single copy of GermNews within the next couple of days, as usual.  </field>

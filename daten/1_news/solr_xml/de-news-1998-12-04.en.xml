<field name="text">During the final reading of the tax-reform law in parliament, the SPD defended the red-green coalition's draft against criticism by the opposition parties. Financial expert Poss, SPD, said that now the tax-burden for workers and families, and the middle classes in general, would become lighter. Financial politics spokesperson Christine Scheel, Greens, even was for pegging benefits paid for children to their parents' income. "All parliamentary groups have agreed a long time ago that tax-rates have to go down, whereas benefits for children and the tax-exemption threshold have to rise. I would like to ask you to agree to today's draft, without any ifs and buts, for the sake of the people in this country." Gerda Hasselfeld, FDP, however warned against negative consequences of the tax-reform. "The planned finance for these measures will lower companies' propensity to invest and will cause problems for the labour market. This will cause more job losses". Opposition parties had already failed to adjourn the debate, claiming lack of time and the absence of Finance Minister Lafontaine.  A majority of SPD and Greens votes gave the green light for a so-called introductory law for the tax-reform. This will raise the benefit paid for children by 30 marks to 250 marks/month; at the same time, the lowest rate of income-tax will drop by 2 percent, to 23.9%. The Upper House (Bundesrat) will have to agree as well, and that's expected to happen within a fortnight.  </field>

<field name="text">The 16 state premiers have continued to discuss about new tax-relations while meeting in Potsdam. The main bone of contention was how the commission should be made up - that's the one to discuss a new tax-transfer system between 'rich' and 'poor' states. SPD-governed states tend to favour a commission consisting of members of federal and state governments, whereas the CDU/CSU-governed states would prefer Lower and Upper House members (Bundestag and Bundesrat). At the end of the meeting, the 16 state premiers passed a resolution regarding European politics. On the one hand they were for a stronger European Union, and that included prospective new members from Eastern Europe, while on the other hand they were against any attempts by the EU-Commission to interfere with national politics  </field>

<field name="text">The Conference of Catholic Bishops in Germany said that living conditions of families would have to attract the same attention as the operating conditions for companies. Society would have to do justice and make up for the economic burden caused by bringing up children. They emphasised that de-facto or same-sex relationships should not be treated like partners living in wedlock and their families  </field>

<field name="text">Members of the public health insurance scheme may expect subscriptions to stay at the same level next year, according to Federal Health Minister Andrea Fischer. The scheme would probably have a surplus of 2 billion marks towards the end of 1998. The minister stated that the main reason for this were massive cost-reductions in the dental treatment area.  </field>

<field name="text">Coach Winfried Schaefer, VfB Stuttgart, threw the towel. That was the 293rd early change of coach since the federal soccer league was started in 1963. Mr Schaefer quoted sport's and other reasons for his step. And at the end of the day, tensions within the team had contributed to his decision. Now the club will begin with a clean slate, Wolfgang Rolff will stand in - he used to be Mr Schaefer's aide - and he will get supported by Mr Jochen Ruecker. Mr Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder deplored the media's attacks during the last few months, which would also have made it impossible for Mr Schaefer to keep working for the club.  </field></doc></add>

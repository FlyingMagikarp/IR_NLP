<field name="text">Predictions are that Brandenburg's SPD will start negotiating with the CDU about forming a coalition with them. That's according to State Premier Stolpe, who said that a commission had recommended this to the party. The CDU would be more inclined to back a policy of social justice, that at the same time would guarantee economic stability. He also emphasised that the partnership between SPD and CDU would not be a marriage made in heaven. Social Affairs Minister Hildebrandt stated that she would not serve under a Big Coalition government. Ms Hildebrandt repeatedly had spoken out in favour of co-operation with the PDS party. The commission is to decide as early as tonight. The SPD had lost its absolute majority at last Sunday's state elections, and therefore will now have to rely on a coalition partner.  </field>

<field name="text">Two days before the state elections in Thueringen, the FDP-party executive asked for the membership of its president, Mr Arendt, to be cancelled. While this was being processed, Mr Arendt would stay suspended, deputy Moeller said at a meeting under urgency in Erfurt. The federal head of the party Gerhardt backed the decision. A special congress will elect a new president, though no date has been set so far. Thuringia's head of the FDP-party had appealed to the electorate to vote for the CDU at last Sundays's elections, as the chances of his party were small.  </field>

<field name="text">Schleswig-Holstein's head of the FDP parliamentary group Kubicki suggested that head of the FDP Gerhardt step down. In the wake of the poor results at recent state elections, the federal head of the party should ask himself if it really made sense to cling to certain views, according to an interview with SPIEGEL Online. At the same time he asked deputy leader Bruederle to show more flag than in the past.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder thanked Hungary for opening up their border to the (free) western countries. He said that this had been an act of courage, with historical consequences, when speaking at a special session of parliament in Budapest. At the time this had enabled thousands of citizens of the then German Democratic Republic (GDR) to enter western countries. Austria's Chancellor Klima said Hungary's decision - which then had still been a communist country - had been a harbinger of the democratic revolution in all of Eastern Europe.  </field>

<field name="text">The SPD parliamentary group was surprised outgoing State Premier Klimmt, of Saarland, was appointed Federal Minister of Transport, according to an interview on radio Deutschlandfunk with head of the SPD parliamentary group Mueller. Quite a few would have had trouble making any sense of the decision. He would welcome Mr Klimmt's appointment; at the end of the day, diverging directions within the party should converge.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bavarian Red Cross (BRK) admitted that they had cheated in the past as far as wages had been concerned. Managing director Fischer said that unfilled vacancies had been booked as filled and claimed for. Last year, 118 positions out of a total of 1526 had been duds. Some 4000 residents of BRK- resthomes had been hurt by the scheme. In 1993, when there had been 11 duds, residents had overpaid to the tune of 715,000 marks. For weeks the BRK had been at the centre of allegations of graft. Recently, the Munich public prosecutor took two former managers to court. They allegedly had taken backhanders from companies manufacturing medical products for years - up to 4.4 million marks.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Trade Union Council (DGB) accused the employers to have welshed on their promises on apprenticeships, pledges they had made for the so-called Treaty for Work. In July the employers had stated that they would create 18,000 new apprenticeships, whereas the 22,000 new apprenticeships that had eventuated this year would have been the result of the federal government's ad-hoc program, according to union executive Goerner. Latest results, however, even suggested that their number had dropped by 6,500. 170,000 young people did not have an apprenticeship, with 92,000 of them 'on hold', for example in schools or jobs.  </field>

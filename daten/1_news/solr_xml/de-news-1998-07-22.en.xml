<field name="text">In connection with the hot election issue of the possible introduction of motorway tolls, Chancellor Kohl (CDU), has called for a European-wide solution to the problem. He said that drivers should not be subject to any further charges but, as tolls are charged in other countries, there was a need for action on the issue. Gerhard Schroeder, the SPD's candidate for Chancellor, has also rejected the levelling of tolls, saying that he too did not think that car drivers should have to pay any more than they do at present. On Wednesday, the EU Commission presented plans for the regulation of traffic charges, including the proposal that commercial road users should contribute to the upkeep of the roads.  </field>

<field name="text">Juergen Trittin, a spokesman for the leadership of the Greens, has proposed that profits made from share transactions and the sale of property should be taxed. In an interview with the newspaper 'Rhein-Zeitung', he said that all ways of making money should be treated in the same way and that any reform of the tax system should abolish the current ruling that profits made from selling shares are tax-free if the sale occurs over six months after the shares were purchased. This suggestion was rejected by the CDU/CSU, the FDP and the SPD equally. The leader of the FDP, Wolfgang Gerhard, said that it would be a blow to small investors, and Joachim Poss, a spokesman on financial affairs for the SPD, warned that such a move might weaken the shares market.  </field>

<field name="text">Jost Stollmann, the SPD candidate for Finance Minister, has called for a radical reform of the tax and benefit system. In an interview with the 'Bild' newspaper, he said that the dramatic changes that have occurred in people's professional lives and careers mean that the social security system can no longer be financed through earned income contributions. Stollman said that the system should be funded through more indirect charges and less direct taxation. However, Oskar Lafontaine, the leader of the SPD, dismissed as "complete rubbish" a report in 'Stern' magazine which claimed that the SPD was planning to raise Value Added Tax in order to lower the benefit contributions paid by employers.  </field>

<field name="text">The representatives of employers and unions in Lower Saxony's metal industry have agreed on a unique contract as a means of securing employment. According to the contract, employees will receive a bonus if they agree to a cut in their hours so that new jobs can be created. It was suggested that the a worker who gave up half of their hours would receive around DM 12,000. An organisation called the "Alliance for Employment" with a budget of DM 10 million has been created to finance the pilot project. The new contract also implements the 'old-age part-time agreement' which has been put into practice in the other contract-agreement areas in the metal industry in west Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal High Court has been hearing an appeal in the arson case in which Safwan Eid, from Lebanon, was found not guilty of having set fire to an asylum-seekers' home in Luebeck in January 1996. The defence and the Public Prosecutor's Office are moving for the not guilty verdict to be sustained. The family of one of the victims are asking for the judgement to be rescinded; they want a judicial decision on whether certain recordings of Eid's conversations whilst in pretrial detention, which allegedly point towards his guilt, should have been presented in court. A decision is expected on Friday.  </field>

<field name="text">The Public Prosecutor's Office has dropped its investigation into the media magnate Leo Kirch and two of his advisors on suspicion of tax evasion, saying that there is not sufficient evidence for a charge. The investigation has been running since 1995, and the Office explained that it has taken to so long because a great deal of the investigation was done abroad. Kirch was suspected of having avoided paying around DM 400 million in tax through a series of bogus transactions in Switzerland.  </field>

<field name="text">The decision of Frankfurt's Higher Regional Court on a euthanasia case has provoked further debate. The president of the Conference of German Bishops, Lehmann, has said that the judgement blurs the distinction between passively helping someone to die and active euthanasia on demand. The German Association of Churches warned against allowing the courts to decide on the legality of euthanasia. The German Hospice Foundation advises people to draw up a written disposition with the aid of a patients' solicitor as soon as possible so that patients can have an influence on their treatment, even when they can no longer make their wishes known.  </field></doc></add>

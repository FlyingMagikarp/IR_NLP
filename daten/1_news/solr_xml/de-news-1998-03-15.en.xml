<field name="text">The Social Democrats' (SPD) candidate for the chancellorship, Gerhard Schroeder, has warned his party not to be prematurely confident of victory and make untenable election promises. Speaking at a convention in Magdeburg, Mr. Schroeder said, in spite of favorable polls, the election on September 27 has not yet been won. Before the SPD promises to withdraw legislature introduced by the present coalition, it has to be made sure that such a policy would be financially sound.  </field>

<field name="text">The Union for Metal, Engineering and Electronics (DGB) has demanded new tariff models that better reflect present work demands. At a conference of the SPD committee for employee issues, the Union's Vice President Mr. Riester said that working hours or the number of units produced are no longer used for the measurement of productivity. What counts in the work place is rather to reach a certain goal by a certain date. This brings into question existing working hour regulations and has to be reflected in collective wage agreements. Mr. Riester rejected criticism of the DGB election campaign. At issue is not a bias for the SPD but partisanship in the interest of employees, he said. DGB Vice President Mrs. Engelen-Kefer said that even the top officials of German industry are biased and help the government.  </field>

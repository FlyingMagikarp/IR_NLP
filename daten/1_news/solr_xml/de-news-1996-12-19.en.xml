<field name="text">The states have stopped an attempt by the Coalition of Bonn to overhaul the vehicle excise tax and employment measures.  In its last session before the Christmas break, the Bundesrat referred the matter of the vehicle excise tax to the mediation committee, since the bill does not adequately offset the losses in the states' tax revenue.  As to the employment measures, the SPD run states, but also CDU representatives opposed cuts in a federal program (ABM) promoting employment, especially in East Germany.  Other coalition bills as well, like health reform and cuts in sick pay for officials, were rejected by the Bundesrat.  On the other hand, green light was given for the 1997 budget bill, despite criticism in several, singular points.  Furthermore the controversial tax law 1997 was passed.  The SPD negotiator, Hamburg's mayor Mr. Vorscherau said on Deutschlandradio Berlin that the states didn't have a choice.  Through the abolition of the tax on cash assets, the states will suffer losses of billions of DM, which would not be compensated for if the bill was rejected, Voscherau continued.  In that context, he mentioned the hike in inheritance tax and the tax on property transactions.  Voscherau again criticized the tax and financial policy of the Coalition as single-sided, bearing down particularly hard on low-income families.  </field>

<field name="text">A preliminary examination of the air travel itineraries of the President of Parliament, Ms. Suessmuth, has apparently failed to yield any evidence for misuse.  The parliamentary vice president, Mr. Klose, said a final evaluation is only possible after a detailed inspection.  He noted that it doesn't take a press release by the SPD to mount activity within the CDU/CSU.  The SPD had mentioned indiscretion from within the CDU/CSU which had made Rita Suessmuth stumble.  Helmut Kohl issued an immediate response through his press spokesman saying that nobody of the CDU leadership wanted to harm Rita Suessmuth.  The head of the CDU parliamentary group, Wolfgang Schaeuble, also came to protect Ms. Suessmuth.  He said he has no doubts that she used the air force exclusively for official purposes.  </field>

<field name="text">Parliamentary President Ms. Suessmuth has obtained an injunction against the Springer publishing house at the Hamburg Regional Court in an urgency decision.  The press office of the Bundestag informed in Bonn tonight that in seven cases, the Springer Corporation has been prohibited to assert the Parliamentary President had used the air force VIP transportation unit for personal purposes this year and last year.  Due to the special criteria for urgency decisions in conflicts involving the press law, Ms. Suessmuth had limited her request to seven cases of false assertions.  It was said, however, that she wants to legally pursue accusations regarding other alleged private flights to Switzerland as well.  </field>

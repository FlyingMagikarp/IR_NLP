<field name="text"> IG Metal Union Head Zwickel has threatened strikes in the battle for full sickpay.  At a major demonstration of the union in Kiel, Mr. Zwickel spoke about a program of injustice for which the federal government and the employers would be held accountable. The latter, he said, were about to substitute "killer capitalism" for social responsibility.  Zwickel emphasized that what had been won forty years ago after a sixteen-week strike could not be taken away today by a breach of contract. Meanwhile, United Metal president, Mr. Stumpfe, introduced another wage contract without raises and hinted at the readiness to compromise on sick pay.  Mr. Stumpfe declared that the main goal had to be lowering of costs in order to preserve jobs.  As of now, he stated, the west German metal and electronic industries were losing 500 jobs a day.  Furthermore, Mr. Stumpfe suggested that workers might have the option of working an additional 1.4 hours per sick day instead of losing pay.  </field>

<field name="text">In the conflict concerning sick pay, employers are not prepared to accept further spontaneous work stoppages.  The president of the Federal Union of Employers' Alliances, Mr. Murmann, announced in the news magazine FOCUS that there would be liability litigation in response.  He literally referred to the work stoppages of the past week as lawless strikes.  Mr. Murmann declared, however, that he was counting on the easing of tensions.  When people stopped being so emotional, he said, workers would come to their senses.  </field>

<field name="text">In the Coalition's quarrel about the federal budget deficit in the billions, FDP Head Gerhard has threatened to break up the Coalition if there were to be more tax increases.  He charged Federal Minister for Finance Weigel with leaving the true budget situation unclear to the government.  Gerhard said, "I am tired of having to discuss new budgets with new figures every week."  He said that the FDP had made its contribution to savings by agreeing to postpone the lowering of the solidarity contribution until 1998.  Meanwhile, the magazine FOCUS claims to have learned that Mr. Waigel is planning further cuts to close the 4 billion Marks gap in the budget.  Supposedly, Mr. Waigel is thinking about a so called reduced expenditure across the board for all the ministries.  A spokesperson for Mr. Waigel stated there was nothing definitive.  But, before the meeting of November 14, it would be made clear how this financial gap is to be closed.  </field>

<field name="text">Lower Saxony's Minister President Schroeder has stated that he favors a postponement of the European Monetary Union.  Debts in Germany, were simply too high, he said during an interview.  The Coalition should finally have the courage to state this candidly. Gerhard Schroeder evidently no longer believes that Germany will be able to meet the conditions for joining the EMU.  "I have ever increasing doubts," the SPD-politician stated, "that we can make it on time.  And if Germany is not part of it, then the whole thing probably doesn't make any sense." As far as Mr. Schroeder is concerned, the time has come for the Bonn government to tell the citizens the truth.  As things stand today, he continued, the Chancellor or the Federal Minister for Finance should say, "We are very sorry, but we won't make it; we are postponing the whole thing." The European Monetary Union [EWU] is to be realized on January 1, 1999.  According to present plans, the Euro is to have taken the place of the German Mark, the Franc, the Shilling the Lira by 30 June 2002.  In connection with his criticism of the European Monetary Union, the head of the government of Lower Saxony charges the federal government with confronting an abyss in matters of finance.  Minister for Finance Waigel should honestly report on the state of finances and offer an affidavit of means.  Mr. Schroeder criticizes "the braggadocio" of the Bonn Coalition.  He said the Coalition has been offering for months to cut a different tax every week - - a chaos which bears no relationship to responsible fiscal policy.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Chancellor Kohl is making a 9-day trip to Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan.  Of course, Mr. Kohl's main aim is to promote economic relations with the three countries.  To begin with, however, the Chancellor will hardly be able to avoid the topic of human rights - - because of the Nobel Peace Prize given to two East Timor critics of the regime.  In violation of the rights of nations, Indonesia has been occupying East Timor since 1975.  Helmut Kohl is traveling to Asia with a large economic delegation.  Underscored by the group accompanying him, the alleged purpose of the trip, namely the solidification and expansion of economic relations, thus far has not been reflected in headlines in Indonesia.  Instead, the daily paper , INDONESIAN OBSERVER, for example, discusses the question whether the German Federal Chancellor will be discussing human rights with Indonesian President Suharto and, after consulting with politically prominent figures in Djakarta, concludes that this will probably not happen.  To be sure, the Chancellor would have the time.  He will be spending all of Sunday on an island with Mr. Suharto; presumably, the order of the day for the two heads of government is exclusively: fishing.  Meanwhile, their cabinet members are not idle.  The ministers for postal services and for research will already be having policy discussions and Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Rexrodt already arrived in Djakarta on Friday evening.  He was accompanied by a large delegation.  They are attending the second German-Indonesian Economic Forum which will be held this weekend.  </field>

<field name="text">Once again, a poisonous waste scandal has been uncovered abroad and, once again, German companies are involved.  Numerous containers of hazardous industrial waste from Germany are currently standing in the harbor of Beirut.  If the waste had been buried, it could have produced hazardous radiation, according to Lebanese government attorneys. A businessman in Lebanon had paid 14 000 Dollars to two German companies which were to send him high quality plastic granular matter in return.  36 containers from Germany did indeed arrive in Beirut harbor but the Lebanese recipient was somewhat surprised about their content.  The containers did not house the plastic granular matter they had agreed upon but rather 750 tons of poisonous waste.  A spokesperson  for the Greenpeace office in Lebanon even knows who is responsible for this deception: "We have all the documents, faxes which prove that two German companies, International Trading and Transport in Saulheim and RC-Gmbh Reifenrecycling in Hagen, these two companies, working together, had these 36 containers with special waste transported via Antwerp and Rotterdam on July 17 and, a few days later, on a number of ships to Beirut."  Greenpeace demands that the poisonous waste be returned to Germany.  Contact was made with the German authorities a week ago but no response was received thus far.  They added that, under no circumstances, could the waste remain in Lebanon.  "In this country, no one knows what to do with this waste.  It is full of a mixture of all kinds of plastics contaminated with chemicals.  As   soon as the attempt is made to destroy something of this sort, we shall have a poisonous soup which will poison the local people." The Lebanon has been popular with international poisonous waste racketeers for quite some time.  As early as 1987 and 1988, Greenpeace informs, ca. 16 000 tons of highly poisonous industrial waste from Italy was transported to Lebanon.   An investigation of the presumed guilty parties has since been stopped.  </field>

<field name="text">The director of the German Alliance of Government Ministers, Mr. Ribs, has been critical of the suggestions made by the Free Democrats concerning legislative rent reform.  On Deutschlandradio Berlin, Mr. Ribs spoke about a catalog of horrors on Saturday.  Especially the FDP suggestion to do away with rent control would lead to an explosion of raises in rent, Mr. Ribs said.  This, he continued, would have effects harmful to the economy since it would leave renters less money to spend on other things.  </field>

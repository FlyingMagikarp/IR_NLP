<field name="text">For the 8th time in a row, the CSU obtained an absolute majority in Bavaria's state parliamentary elections. According to official, if preliminary, results, Premier Stoiber's party obtained 52.9% of votes cast, as compared to 52.8 four years ago. State chairwoman Schmid's SPD obtained 28.7%, a 1.3% loss against 1994. Buendnis90/The Greens lost .4% against 1994, but the 5.7% they received were sufficient to make them the third party represented in the "Landtag". Seats in the Landtag (state parliament) will be distributed as follows: CSU - 123 seats, a gain of 3 ; SPD - 67 seats, a loss of 3 ;  The Greens: 14 seats - unchanged.

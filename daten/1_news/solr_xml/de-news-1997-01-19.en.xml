<field name="text">Wolfgang Schaeuble, head of the CDU/CSU faction, has for the first time mentioned the names of potential candidates for Chancellorship. There were several politicians in the Christian Union that have the capabilities for a high leadership position, Schaeuble said in the weekly Bild am Sonntag. These were amongst others State Premiers Biedenkopf and Stoiber, the federal ministers Ruehe, Waigel, Kanther, Ruettgers, and Toepfer. Former Interior Minister Seiters, too, were qualified for the job. Schaeuble, however, underlined that the question about who would succeed Helmut Kohl came too early. He would prefer if Kohl were reelected as Chancellor in 1998. Schaeuble was asked whether he would exclude himself from the group of potential successors. He answered that he was very content with his role as head of the Bundestag faction and he did not feel any urge to become Chancellor.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Helmut Kohl has rejected criticism of Finance Minister Theo Waigel from within the party. In a newspaper interview Kohl said the demand for a cabinet reshuffle was completely out of the way. Waigel was a successful finance minister with a good international reputation. Lower Saxony's CDU president Wulf had called for Waigel's replacement because the tax reform committee would not get ahead under Waigel's leadership. Kohl called the statement an individual attempt to distinguish oneself, which he could not understand. The State Premier of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Manfred Seite, too, criticized the tax plans. The CDU politician said in the daily Leipziger Volkszeitung if the discussion kept going the same way as it does now, the result would be just a tiny reform. With this, the CDU would not win the 1998 general elections.  </field>

<field name="text">A debate on the party's statutes marked the morning of the last day of the PDS party congress. In the afternoon, the delegates voted on a motion intended to reduce the influence of such groups as the Communist platform. The groups should no longer be allowed to send delegates to the party congresses. This was supposed to make the PDS more predictable according to the party leadership. The party left wing, however, wanted to hold fast at the old statutes. A motion on the first day to remove the motion to change the statutes from the agenda, however, had failed. In the end, the motion to change the statutes was turned down and the Communist platform will retain the privilege to send their own delegates to the next party congress. Since 1990 the platform was alloted 6 delegates. The various interest groups within the PDS may send as many as 20 delegates in total.  </field>

<field name="text">Vice-president of the National Federation of Unions Ursula Engelen-Kefer has called on the government to take decisive steps against so-called pseudo-self-employment. By driving employees into alleged self-employment the social insurance would lose DM10 billion annually, said Ms. Engelen-Kefer in an interview with the daily Luebecker Nachrichten. The evasion of social insurance contributions was a criminal offence that, however, was rarely prosecuted, in spite of the common knowledge that the corresponding laws were violated hundreds of thousands of times each year.  </field>

<field name="text">Employers president Dieter Hundt has spoken in favour of reducing the pension level. At the same time he called for more private pension plans and individual accountability for social insurance. In a newspaper interview Hundt said an [average] pension level of 72 percent could not be maintained in the long run. Earlier, Labour Minister Norbert Bluem had already stated that the pension level needed to be adjusted. The current system of old age provision was burdened by the decreasing number of contributors while at the same time pensions had to be paid for a longer time. Bluem, however, did not want to confirm the mentioned reduction of the pension level to 63 percent.  </field>

<field name="text">The citizens of Regensburg have been called today to vote on the future of the 850-year-old world-famous Stone Bridge across the River Danube because daily traffic destroys the bridge. One proposal calls for the restriction of the bridge for private traffic only. Busses, taxis, cyclists, and pedestrians would be allowed to continue to use the bridge. The alternative is to close the bridge only after a replacement bridge has been built. The bridge is the only street connecting downtown Regensburg with the subdivision Stadt am Hof.  </field>

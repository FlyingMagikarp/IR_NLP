<field name="text">The Federal Government coalition's reform plans for health insurance have been rejected by the majority of representatives at a hearing before the Health Comitttee of the Bundestag lower house. Health insurers, trade unions, doctors and welfare organisations were critical of the proposals and said they were designed to undermine the principle of solidarity. Furthermore, the mooted transformation of statutory services into so-called "Gestaltungsleistungen" (offering more flexibility) was not the right way to lower health care costs. The company-owned health insurers were the only group of those present at the hearing to be of the opinion that the proposal was right in principle. The pharmaceutical industry and employer organisations alse welcomed the measures.  </field>

<field name="text">In the wage bargaining conflict for the metals and engineering sector in Lower Saxony, both parties announced they had found some common ground after a hastily scheduled first meeting. No details were made available. Negotiator for the employers Niemsch said he was hopeful that the "IG Metall" union and the employers would be able to come up with a precedence agreement during the night. A major sticking point is paid sick leave, along with a wage rise for next year. Wage bargaining talks on these issues have not been successful so far in Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia.  </field>

<field name="text">The employees of Hanover biscuit maker Bahlsen will keep on receiving full paid sick leave benefits. After 15 hours of negotiations, that is the result of talks between the company and the "Nahrung, Genuss, Gaststaetten" (food, luxury food, gastronomy) union. The agreement is the first company-internal wage accord in Bahlsen's history. One restriction on the paid sick leave is the requirement of having been a Bahlsen employee for at least 7 months. The union announced it was to end its strike action, which had dragged on for 10 days. Meanwhile, the Luebeck Labour Court yesterday ruled that a strike at the plant of marzipan manufacturer Niederegger ist unlawful. The judges said the cancellation of paid sick leave did not mean the termination of the general wage bargaining agreement. This meant that the "obligation to keep the peace" on the wage bargaining partners remained in force.  </field>

<field name="text">President of the Association of Sudeten-Germans Neubauer has reiterated his organisation's position on the planned German-Czech reconciliation declaration. Speaking on "Deutschlandfunk" public radio this morning, Neubauer said he did not know the wording of the new agreement between the two governments. Talks with the Federal Government however were of little use if everything had already been decided, he added. If this were the case, then once again a binding decision had been reached without consultation of those affected by it, Neubauer said. He again emphasised that the Sudeten-Germans wanted their expulsion to be called an "injustice".  </field>

<field name="text">Secret Service Coordinator Schmidbauer has defended himself against the opposition's accusation of having engaged in "parallel foreign policy" in the Mauss affair. During parliament question time today, the Minister of State at the Chancellor's Officer called the charge "moronic conjecture". Foreign Minister Kinkel supported his actions fully and shared the political responsibility for them, Schmidbauer continued. He justified the cooperation with controversial private investigator Mauss during the freeing of hostages in Colombia as humanitarian aid, and said he would always use unconventional measures such as these if people's lives were at stake. He also confirmed that Mauss had tried to arrange negotiations between the Colombian government and the GLN guerillas.  </field>

<field name="text">The number of immigrant ethnic Germans in January has fallen again in comparison to last year's figures. According to Mr. Waffenschmidt, the Federal Government's Commissioner for Ethnic Germans, around 10,000 ethnic Germans immigrated to Germany last month. Last year the figure was almost 15,000. More than 90 percent of the immigrants came from states in the former Soviet Union. Mr. Waffenschmidt said that reasons for the fall in numbers include German financial aid to Eastern and South Eastern Europe and the introduction of German language tests. Experience has shown that a third of the so-called ethnic Germans from Russia and Kazachstan do not have the legally required knowledge of the German language.  </field>

<field name="text">Health insurance schemes would like to cover members' dentistry costs for treatment overseas. A spokesman for the Federal Association for the AOK (the state health insurance plan) said to the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" that the idea of covering dentistry costs incurred overseas was attractive to the various state health insurance schemes, as this could lower costs and increase competition.

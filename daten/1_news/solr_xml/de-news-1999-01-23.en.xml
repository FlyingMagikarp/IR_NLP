<field name="text">With negotiations about to begin between German energy concerns and Mr. Trittin, the Minister of the Environment, there are no signs of compromise. Trittin, a Green, rejected an offer by the power companies to stop reprocessing nuclear fuel in 5 years, as opposed to stopping in the year 2000.   Minister Trittin also refused to give in to the industry's demand that 100 Castor transports a year be permitted after the reprocessing ban has gone into effect, because this figure is excessive in view of the actual amount of nuclear waste being generated.  As for the industry's plans that the waste might be sent to Russia, Trittin called the idea absurd.  </field>

The small party caucus passed a resolution titled "Equal Rights For All."  In it, the Greens appealed to the populace not to sign the CSU/CDU petitions against dual citizenship.

<field name="text">There might be bottlenecks in train service at the beginning of the week.  As a consequence of the recent train accident, 600 cars in local service have been pulled for safety checks.  The wheels of train cars are supposed to be checked for stability.  Cars from the former German Reichsbahn are having their wheel plates inspected to make sure they are safe.  German Rail decided on this course of action after inspections showed that the wheel fittings of these wagons are of the same design as those of the regional express that derailed last week.  A spokesman emphasized that this was purely a precautionary measure.  The recall might cause local service bottlenecks in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin and Brandenburg and may also affect Lower Saxony and Bremen.  The measure will have no effect on long distance travel.  </field>

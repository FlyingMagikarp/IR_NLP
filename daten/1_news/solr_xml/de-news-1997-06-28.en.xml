<field name="text">Bavarian Minister President Stoiber continues to insist on a strict interpretation of the Maastricht criteria for the Euro.  The CSU politician told the ZDF on Friday evening that people in Germany were much more skeptical about giving up their currency than the people of other countries.  Thus watering down the criteria for the introduction of the Euro would be a mistake in psychological terms. The net debt limit of three percent, he continued, was not arrived at by chance.  It was necessary, he said, in order for the Euro to become as stable as the mark. During an interview with the LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG, the parliamentary faction leader of the CDU/CSU, Mr. Schaeuble, charged that Mr. Stoiber was making the people feel unsure by debating about the stability of the Euro.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Minister for Finance, Mr. Waigel once again warned against discussing the postponement of the introduction of the common European currency.  At the district party convention of the CSU of Central Franconia in Gunzenhausen, he openly expressed his disagreement with Bavarian Minister President Stoiber.  Mr. Waigel emphasized that it is precisely an economy as dependent on exports as the German economy which has to count on the common currency. At the same time, he affirmed the determination of the Bonn Coalition to the strict observance of the deficit criterion of 3.0 percent.  Mr. Ost, head of the economic policy committee of the Parliament made a similar statement.  The CDU politician told the DEUTSCHLANDFUNK that further efforts in financial and economic policies were necessary for the fulfillment of the conditions of participation.  </field>

<field name="text">In order to close budget gaps, the Bonn government has directed the Federal Labor Institute to sell outstanding claims to a bank.  The head of the executive board of the Nuernberg agency told the HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that this was an attempt to cover up the desolate condition of the budget with increasingly adventuresome measures.  The total value of the loans which the Federal Labor Institute had granted to installations for the handicapped, ABM carriers but also to the unemployed, amounted to 2.2 billion marks, she said.  But, Mrs. Engeles-Fischer continued, the bank would obviously only accept the sale at discounts in nine figures.  </field>

<field name="text">Two days after the coalition in the Bundestag introduced their tax reform plan, the discussion about it has entered a new round. Representitives of the coalition and the SPD opposition accused one another of blocking an agreement. Minister of the Chancellor's Office Bohl said in an interview that that the SPD has got to get off of the brake pedal. At the same time he pressed for new talks with the Social Democrats. These could occur during the summer legislative break, according to Bohl, in order to reach a quick settlement. When the comments of the leaders politicians of the SPD are considered, however, the chances of this settlement occuring are apparently slight. For instance, Niedersachsen's Minister President Schroeder said that he doubts that tax reform can still occur in this legislative period. The tax plans of the coalition are not financeable, he said. The SPD could agree at some point to the dismantling of tax on investment capital and to the reduction of employee benefit costs. SPD chief Lafontaine sees chances for agreement to some extent with the reduction of social contributions or of the unification taxes. In Lafontaine's opinion it is the government's responsibility that no compromise has yet been reached. The SPD-dominated Bundesrat will take up the debate this coming Friday. One week later the bill will go to the reconciliation committee, where the desire for compromise will show itself.  </field>

<field name="text">Eight months before the next Landtag elections the Green party in Lower Saxony has ruled out a coalition to aid the Social Democrats. At the caucus in Hitzacker a resolution to this effect did not win the necessary majority among party heads. The justification for the vote was based on the content of platforms in the final analysis. The most important goal was an economic policy that carried the ecological requirements out in a programmatic way. The Green Party was not available for the mere purpose of ensuring a majority for the SPD government. The delegates accused Minister President Schroeder of having waged a campaign of social demolition. A stronger commitment to environmental issues on the part of SPD politicians was also called for.  </field>

<field name="text">There is no option for Lower Saxony's Minister President Schroeder of making a coalition with the FDP. He characterized North Rhine-Westphalia FDP leader Moellemann's proposition in Duesseldorf that he, Moellemann, could be open to a possible breaking of the red-green coalition to create a social liberal coalition and so send a signal before the Federal Elections. Schroeder considered the offer to be overly self-important. The SPD politician told the THURINGER ALLGEMEINE, published in Erfurt, that no government could be made with the one-sided client politics of the FDP. Schroeder is considered one of the possible Chancellor candidates in his party.  </field>

<field name="text">Both the federal and state governments are offering subsidies to Kosovo refugees in Germany who volunteer for their repatriation at the earliest possible date. After a Bonn meeting of minister for internal affairs Schily with his state counterparts, the minister said that this could not take place before the situation in Kosovo was stabilized. For this reason, Germany was participating in the planned 3,000 man international police force with a contingent of 210 police officers. Roughly 15,000 refugees found shelter in Germany during the Kosovo war. Their repatriation was not the main problem, Schily said. Rather more complicated was the situation of some 180,000 Kosovo ethnic Albanians who have been living in Germany for a longer time but are due to return. Their repatriation would probably not be possible before the spring of 2000.  </field>

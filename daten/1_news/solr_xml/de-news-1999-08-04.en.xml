<field name="text">Following the example set by the CDU/CSU, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has now also personally addressed German seniors in a letter. In it, he reaffirmed his government's intention of introducing a tax-financed guarantee of old-age security especially for those receiving the smallest pensions, "in order to prevent poverty in old-age". Meanwhile, the FDP has appealed to all parties to return to a consensus on pensions. The party has offered to mediate. SPD caucus leader Peter Struck announced a meeting with FDP leader Wolfgang Schaeuble in September.  </field>

<field name="text">The Social-Democratic premier of the Saarland, Klimmt, has again criticized the federal government, thus ignoring an appeal by Chancellor Schroeder for greater party discipline. In an interview, Klimmt said that the goal of cutting federal expenditures by 30 billion DM must not become a matter of dogma. The finance spokesman for the Green Party, Metzger, subsequently called Klimmt a security risk to the federal Coalition. Klimmt belongs to the left wing of the SPD. He is protesting against the reform policies of the Coalition. State elections in the Saarland are to be held on September 5.  </field>

<field name="text">Over British protests, the EU Commission has decided to give Germany more time to resume imports of British beef. It is expected that the German ban will be lifted following the session of the Bundesrat on September 24. However, there is no official deadline for the lifting of the ban. German Federal Health Minister Fischer, in a BBC interview, defended German reservations. She said she wanted to make sure that safety measures against mad-cow disease were working. The EU veterinary committee also today announced its decision that Belgium must now examine its beef for dioxins before it goes to market.  </field>

<field name="text">The odds that store hours will be liberalized before the end of this year are increasing all the time. Although the federal government does not currently see any need to discuss easing the restrictions of the Store Hours Law (Ladenschlussgesetz), a majority of the states do favour the idea. Several state ministers have already come out in favour of allowing shops to remain open until at least 6 pm on Saturdays. There does not appear to be any prospect of shops being open on Sundays. Many businesses, however, have said that they would like to open their doors on Sundays as well.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal manager of the civilian service program (alternative to compulsory military service for objectors), Hackler, has admitted that reducing the term of service from 13 months to 11 could cause problems. He told the Rheinsche Post newspaper that existing civilian service positions could not necessarily be filled on a smooth, continuous basis if the term of service were only 11 months. The CDU/CSU warned against gutting the civilian service program any further. CDU/CSU deputy caucus leader, Ruettgers, told SWR radio that civilian service was an essential part of the German social system. The FDP want military and civilian service shortened to terms of 5-6 months.  </field></doc></add>

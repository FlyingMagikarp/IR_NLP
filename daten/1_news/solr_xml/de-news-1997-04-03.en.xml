<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl has voiced his intention to run again in the federal parliamentary elections next year.  At his vacation retreat in Bad Hofgastein in Austria, Mr. Kohl told the ARC TV station that he feels it is his duty to stand for re-election, in view of the current political challenges.  The Chancellor celebrates his 67th birthday today.  He said his decision was motivated by a desire to contribute to the on-going construction of European unity and the eastward expansion of NATO.  Mr. Kohl also stressed the importance of the timely implementation of the European Monetary Union in 1999.  Mr. Kohl has served as Chancellor since October 1st 1982 - longer than any previous Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">The parties of the government have welcomed Mr. Kohl's desire to run again in the elections next year.  The head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Mr. Schaeuble, said that Kohl could count on their support.  The FDP chairman Mr. Gerhard explained that the Chancellor's decision paves the way for a continuation of the Coalition.  The SPD and The Greens, however, predicted that Mr. Kohl would lose in 1998.  The head of the SPD parliamentary group, Mr. Scharping, declared Mr. Kohl's policies a failure.  He went on to say that, in view of the highest unemployment and the largest federal debt in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, the time has come for a change of power.  The Social Democrats have declared their intention not to select their candidate before April of next year.  The spokesman for the executive board of Alliance 90/The Greens, Mr. Trittin, said that the population will now have the opportunity to call the Chancellor to account and to vote him out of office.  </field>

<field name="text">The friction between Germany and Turkey continues to increase.  Interior Minister Kanther has called on the Turkish government to refute immediately a statement by the Turkish Interior Minister Ms. Axena. According to the semi-official Turkish news agency Anadolu, the Minister had said with reference to the Germans: "They can't throw us out [of the country], but now they burn us alive."  Mr. Kanther commented he considers it incredible that a member of the Turkish government did actually say this.  Mr.  Kanther called the fact that Ankara immediately refuted this latest statement an act of great political significance.  The Turkish Ambassador to Bonn was summoned to the Foreign Office.  Secretary of State, Mr. von Ploetz, declared that it was unacceptable for official Turkish agencies to contribute to prejudices and insinuations and to mount attacks against the German government.  </field>

<field name="text">Marcel Avram, one of the world's leading concert promoters, was arrested in Munich yesterday and is now in police custody.  Mr. Avram, chairman of Mama Concerts, is charged with tax fraud.  Prior to his arrest, his office and private residence had been searched.  Mr. Avram and his agency Mama Concerts are considered to be one of the largest event organizers.  Hardly a day goes by when 59-year-old Avram cannot be seen side-by-side with any star of the music business in the Munich popular press.  Of his present surroundings, however, there are unlikely to be any pictures, for Mr. Avram has been in solitary confinement in the Munich-Stadelheim jail since last night, when the investigating judge executed the arrest warrant issued several days previously.  The charges are tax fraud.  Although the investigation has been underway for three years, it remains unclear, whether Avram was the sole beneficiary of these practices, or whether his music star clients with permanent residences abroad are also implicated. The auditors have seized numerous boxes of documents which will be examined during the coming months.  </field>

<field name="text">Members of the Philharmonic Orchestra of the Thuringian city of Suhl have begun a hunger strike.  They are protesting against the imminent dissolution of the orchestra.  The authorities in Suhl have withdrawn the orchestra's 3.5 million DM funding.

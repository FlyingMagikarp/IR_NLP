<field name="text">The budget debate in the Bundestag today turned into a traditional wide-open verbal sparring match between the government and the opposition. The federal government insisted on putting through its ideas for reforming the German "social state". It defended itself against heavy attacks from the opposition. Each side said the other was incapable of doing any kind of a good job of shaping Germany's future. At the beginning of the session, the leader of the SPD's forces in the Bundestag, Scharping, attacked the Chancellor, saying that Kohl was responsible for Germany's present situation, with high unemployment and tax increases. Scharping accused Kohl of looking for a scapegoat for his failed economic policies and, in his desperation, blaming the country's employers. He continued that Kohl was trying to sneak out of his responsibility for jobs and social justice. Scharping also called for the government to work with his party in lowering secondary wage costs, and to turn away from social confrontation: "The person who responds to global competition with confrontation has not understood the principles upon which Germany's economic strength is based". The leader of the CDU/CSU group in the Bundestag, Schauble, rejected Scharping's criticisms, saying that the situation in the federal states with SPD governments showed that the Social Democrats themselves had no ideas for solving the present problems. He suggested that it was the wrong approach to today's problems to start a new debate on the distribution of wealth. He said the SPD was still just calling for more government and more bureaucracy, and could not offer even a single savings measure of its own. Schauble also said that in the Bundesrat the SPD was blockading the government's planned cuts to subsidies. The government member did admit, however, that secondary wage costs were too high and had to be lowered. Chancellor Kohl called on the SPD to work with the coalition to find solutions. At the same time, he reiterated criticism of the SPD's "blockade policy" in the Bundesrat. Kohl said that, as an example, reforming the pension system would require cooperation between the parties; partisan politics would have to take a back seat to the problems facing the country. He said that the fight against unemployment would continue to be a priority, and the government would stick to its goal of halving the number of unemployed (presently approximately 4 million) by the year 2000. The leader of the SPD party, Lafontaine, affirmed that the SPD was willing to cooperate in order to fight unemployment, for example, but said that the government's economic policies were wrong from the ground up, as they diminished people's purchasing power. Lafontaine repeated the Social Democrats' demands for changes to the tax system to make it more just. He accused the coalition of throwing money at the well-off by eliminating the wealth tax. Kerstin Muller, the leader of the parliamentary forces of the Green Party, accused the government of no longer having a social conscience. She said her party would continue to be committed to preventing the worst social injustices. Following the discussions, the governmental majority in the Bundestag approved the chancellor's budget, as well as the budgets of the ministries of foreign affairs and defence. Traditionally, the opposition uses the occasion of the chancellor's budget to call the government to general account. In opening the session, Bundestag President Sussmuth remembered the late vice-president of the Bundestag, Hans Klein, who died yesterday. Sussmuth praised especially Klein's readiness to stand up in defence of democracy.  </field>

<field name="text">Opel's parent company, General Motors (GM), has had its first victory in a dispute with Volkswagen (VW). An American court has agreed to hear GM's industrial spying case against Volkswagen. If found guilty, Volkswagen would automatically have to pay damages of three times the losses claimed by GM - up to 4 billion marks, according to the American magazine "Business Week". The court will see if a settlement between General Motors and Volkswagen can be reached. The judge in charge of the case has set up a meeting between the two sides for the coming week. GM accuses former Opel manager, now Volkwagen's purchasing executive, Lopez, of taking confidential documents with him when he moved to VW, and so causing GM losses in the billions of marks. Opel is presently rejecting any out-of-court settlement.  </field>

<field name="text">Frankfurt (Main). After the failure of preliminary negotiations in the metals industry in North Rhine-Westphalia, IG Metall union leader Zwickel sees no chance of a compromise with the employers' association, Gesamtmetall. Zwickel said that the employers had, in three round of negotiations, shown themselves to be incapable of coming to an agreement within the legal limits of time and negotiating tactics. Zwickel said "Obviously, we will have to strike some sense into Gesamtmetall". His vice-chairman Riester emphasized that if no settlement had been reached by the end of February (when the legal moratorium on industrial action during contract negotiations runs out) then the first vote on the possibility of a strike would most likely be held in Bavaria. Meanwhile, the chairman of the employers' association, Stumpfe, is still hoping for a peaceable solution. Referring to the upcoming negotiations in individual regions, Stumpfe said that employers everywhere were ready to resolve the issue of sick pay. He added that the coming weeks would present numerous opportunities for regional negotiations to result in an agreement which might be acceptable throughout the country. In return, Stumpfe said, employers demanded alternatives in lowering wage costs. He added that if the union wanted to carry on down the path of conflict, and seek a solution in industrial action, then it alone would bear the responsibility for stalling the economic upswing again.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Constitutional Court has again rejected a case brought forward on behalf of children against the Summer Smog Law. 126 complainants were fighting the 1995 law because they thought it allowed ozone levels that were too high. They argued that the basic right of children to be protected from health risks was thus not being respected. As it did last year, too, the Constitutional Court ruled that the measures provided for by law, such as the introduction of the catalytic converter or temporary traffic bans, were sufficient and hence not subject to constitutional challenge.  </field>

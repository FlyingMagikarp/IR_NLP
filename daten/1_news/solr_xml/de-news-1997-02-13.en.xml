<field name="text">The governing coalition and the Social Democratic Party are to commence joint talks about the tax reform before the end of this month. The secretary-general of the CDU, Mr. Hintze, told the German Press Agency in Bonn that he expected an offer of talks to be made to the SPD. He said the tax reform represented the most important project for increased growth and employment. It would be beneficial to achieve a swift agreement with the states governed by Social Democrats. Earlier the parliamentary spokesman for the Social Democrats, Mr. Scharping, announced that the coalition would be invited to talks before the end of February. The spokesman for the CDU/CSU coalition, Mr. Hoerster, replied that the coalition would prefer to wait until the draft reform proposals had been successfully drawn up. This is expected to be some time in March. The Secretary of the Chancellor's Office, Mr. Bohl, stated that discussions could begin 3-4 weeks after Easter at the earliest. The Ministry of Finance has referred back to the Finance Minister Waigel's statement, that the talks should begin as soon as possible and should include a discussion about the wage reform planned for next year. Waigel explained yesterday that some sections of the tax reform could also be implemented in the coming year.  </field>

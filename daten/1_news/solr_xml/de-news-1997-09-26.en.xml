<field name="text">Arbitrator Spoeri, who was trying to sort out things when award-talks in Baden-Wuerttemberg's metal-industry hit a stalemate over plans for early retirement/part-time work, agreed that they in fact seemed to have got nowhere. And aggro and stress had got worse, too. A spokes-person for the union agreed that they effectively were stuck. The main bone of contention was and is if the agreement would get written into the awards, making it compulsory for all employers concerned.  </field>

<field name="text">The Dusseldorf Upper Regional Court sentenced a man from Serbia to life imprisonment for war-crimes he had committed in Bosnia. The 50-year old man was convicted of 11 cases of genocide, 30 murders and unlawful detention. Allegedly he had played a major role in the killing of Muslims in 1992. The court followed the public prosecutor's plea. Defence counsel had claimed that the case was not within the court's jurisdiction, and wanted their client released. The verdict stated that, as the crimes were particularly grave, there would be no question of releasing the offender after 15 years (on parole).  </field>

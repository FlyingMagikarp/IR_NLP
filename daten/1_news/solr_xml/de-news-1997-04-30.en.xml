<field name="text">The CDU has strongly denied reports which claim that the party took bribes from the French oil company 'Elf'. Hintze, the CDU's general secretary, said that the party has never received money from any French source. According to a report in a French newspaper, the oil multinational Elf paid out DM 13.5 million during its take-over of the East German company Minol, and part of this went to the CDU. Hintze maintains that no part of the CDU - neither the federal party nor the regional organisation - has received any support either directly or indirectly from France or from Elf; the CDU has certainly not accepted money in this way through its sister-party, the CSU. The CSU also issued a denial from its headquarters in Munich. Hintze said that it was outrageous that such a monstrous allegation should be brought up to discredit the Franco-German relationship during the French elections. He continued, saying that the CDU officially received a total of DM 38 million in donations during 1992, so it would hardly be possible to hide a bribe of DM 13 million; if a donation of above DM 20,000 is accepted, the donor's identity must be revealed.  </field>

<field name="text">The Iranian religious leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has decided that the German ambassador will not be allowed to return to his post at present. Khamenei announced this at a rally, saying that other ambassadors could return if they wanted to. Welajati, the Iranian foreign minister, told journalists in Tehran "we will not welcome the return of certain ambassadors", naming Germany and Denmark in particular. The ambassadors had been recalled in mid-April as a result of the 'Mykonos' trial in Berlin, but EU foreign ministers decided yesterday that they should return to Iran. Iran's declaration provoked mixed reactions in Bonn. Schmuelling, a government spokesman, said that the government had been surprised by Iran's decision, but added that the reports were still unconfirmed. Heuer, a secretary of state at the foreign office, said that Germany should not overreact, he was sure that the other countries of Europe would stand with Germany if Iran's threat should turn out to be seriously meant. Vogt (SPD) said that Iran's behaviour was a slap in the face for the foreign ministers of the EU; their decision to send their ambassadors back to Iran had been taken too quickly and had been seen as a sign of weakness. Joschka Fischer, the leader of the parliamentary party of the Greens called for Foreign Minister Kinkel to resign.  </field>

<field name="text">Foreign minister Klaus Kinkel has arrived in the Romanian capital at the start of an official visit to the country which will last for two days. As he was welcomed by the Romanian foreign minister, Severin, Kinkel said that he expected that Romania would be accepted as a member of NATO and the EU in the near future; the country had made enormous economic and political progress. He continued, saying that Germany knew from its own experience how difficult such a transitional period could be. The Romanian government is hoping that Kinkel will make a clear statement on Germany's position as to Romania's chances of being admitted to NATO in the first wave of expansion. Kinkel is in Romania to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the German-Romanian friendship treaty.  </field>

<field name="text">The accident involving poisonous gases which occurred yesterday at a foundry in Baar in Swabia in which three people were injured was apparently caused by human error. Workers at the plant had washed chrome and not steel, as should have been the case, in a container using acid. This caused a chemical reaction and the resulting compounds overflowed out of the container and a cloud of poisonous gas was released. Around 50 litres of the acid escaped into the river Baar through the sewage system, killing the fish in the river.  </field>

<field name="text">The celebrations for Walpurgisnacht have begun in several towns. There have been colourful street parties and nostalgic parades where people, mostly dressed up as witches, devils and ghosts, paraded through the streets to open air dancing places where they will play out typical Walpurgisnacht games, awaiting the arrival of devils and witches from all over Europe, following the story of an old Germanic saga.

<field name="text">There have been incidents at the nuclear power-plants of Kruemmel and Brunsbuettel. At Kruemmel, a safety-nut on a control-rod for the reactor's pressure chamber had come loose. Control-rods are used to regulate power, and also to shut down the reactor, when/if required. The Ministry thought that this was extremely serious, safety-wise. So far this had never happened before in Germany. Kruemmel had been switched off 4 weeks ago for maintenance and checks.  This afternoon the Brunsbuettel reactor experienced an emergency shut-down. The company running the reactor said that this was due to an operator error. If there is a danger of the reactor getting out of control, it will automatically shut itself down. So far no-one knows when it will be started up again.  </field>

<field name="text">German Railways (Deutsche Bahn AG) will not raise prices, according to CEO Ludewig on ZDF television, and there were no plans for that either. The debate had been started by a leaked internal discussion-paper.  Yesterday rumours had surfaced that German Railways not only planned to run less long-distance trains, but also wanted to revamp their pricing structure. To better their load-factor, prices should be lowered when demand was low, and they should go up at peak-times, according to a company spokesperson in Frankfurt/Main. Details would have to be worked out with the federal states. Approximately 109 long-distance trains could be affected by the revamp  </field>

<field name="text">The Brandenburg Supreme Constitutional Court ruled against all the complaints about resettling the village of Hornow in the Lower Lausitz district. According to the court, resettling the village to enable opencast lignite mining was not against the state constitution. A complaint by the PDS-party had been shot down a month ago, for the same reasons. On 27 September, Hornow will now disappear from the face of the earth, and some 350 inhabitants will have to live somewhere else.  </field>

<field name="text">Billboard adverts used in the Bavarian state elections caused a bit of a stir. The Alliance/Greens-party used the slogan "Mr Beckstein would also deport Jesus" - referring to the Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein's backing of re-patriating refugees from former Yugoslavia. A spokesperson for the Augsburg bishop's office then recommended tit-for-tat, such as: "The Greens would also abort Jesus". CSU-politician Beckstein said there would be no counter-adverts. He had nothing to do with the church's spokesperson's ideas.  </field>

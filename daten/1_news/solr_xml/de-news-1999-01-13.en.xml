<field name="text">In Bonn, both the federal government and the opposition submitted plans for the reform of the citizenship laws and better integration of foreigners. The draft proposal of the Red-Green coalition would allow dual citizenship in the future. Interior Minister Schily wants to attach conditions to the granting of German citizenship such as loyalty to the principles of the German constitution, lack of a criminal record, and adequate knowledge of the German language. Additionally applicants would have to prove their ability to support themselves without social or unemployment assistance. Schily explained the that the government's primary purpose is not the introduction of dual citizenship, but rather intensified efforts toward integration. The CDU/CSU reiterated its opposition to dual citizenship. Deputy Party Chief Ruettger said the goal should be a combination of better integration of foreigners currently residing in Germany with a further restriction on immigration. The CDU organization in Hesse wants to start the petition campaign against the federal government's plan, which the party leadership still needs to approve, on Saturday.  </field>

<field name="text">The outcome of the European parliament's planned vote of no confidence tomorrow against the EU Commission is still uncertain. President Santer of the EU-Commission threatened resignation, attempting to achieve agreement between the two bodies. More than 100 delegates of the European People's Party pledged their support of the Commission in response. Two multi-party resolutions will be taken up in tomorrow's vote. The Liberals, Christian Democrats, and Greens are calling for the resignation of the French EU-Commissioner Cresson. They also want the Commission to look into the responsibility borne by Cresson's colleague Marin. The Socialists, Leftists and the Radical European Alliance only want the appointment of an investigating committee. A formal vote of no confidence can only be taken against the entire EU-Commission. It requires a two-thirds majority to pass.  </field>

<field name="text">Extortion threats have been received again by German Rail (Deutsche Bahn). According to a spokesperson in Frankfurt/Main, the person issuing the threats is demanding the release of the railway extortionist arrested in December. A threatening letter to that effect was received in Cologne around the beginning of the month. No further details were given. German Rail and federal investigators assume that the culprits in this case are "copycats". The spokesperson stressed that German Rail has continued to receive new threats ever since the extortion attempts prior to Christmas. For this reason, the rail lines will continue to be patrolled from the air by the Federal Border Police.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">Tonight the Bundestag (lower house of the parliament) eventually decided to give up the monopoly of the German Postal Service. In a roll-call vote 313 representatives voted for the reform, while 279 rejected it. In the debate members of the opposition at times heavily criticized the government's bill. A deterioration of service and the loss of jobs were to be feared. The new law provides that from January 1, 1998 on competitors may also distribute letters, in addition to parcels which they already may distribute. The Postal Service will only keep a monopoly for standard letters weighing less than 100g. The Social Democrats (SPD) vowed to veto and thereby kill the reform in the Bundesrat (upper house of the parliament).  Earlier, the Bundestag resolved a lowering of the solidarity surcharge. The reduction from 7.5 to 5.5 per cent beginning on January 1, 1998 means a relief for tax payers of about DM7 billion. It will be financed mainly through postponements in refunds granted by the Debt Redemption Fund.  At the first hearing on the "Grand Bugging Attack" an interfactional consensus about the compromise of the governing coalition and the Social-Democrats (SPD) emerged.  In the debate on the 7th anniversary of the German Reunification speakers from all parties emphasized the high unemployment rate as the most pressuring problem in the new Bundeslaender.  </field>

<field name="text">Matthias Hintze from Brandenburg, who had been kidnapped three weeks ago, was found dead in a soil dug-out where he had been held prisoner. The exact cause of death, however, can no longer be determined. The 20-year-old man died probably due to lack of either air, water, or food. The interrogation of the two Russian suspects is expected to reveal further information. The police found the corpse that was already heavily decomposing, in a four-meter-deep hole in the ground. One of the two suspects showed the officers to the crime site located in a forest area near Wahren, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Hintze had been kidnapped on September 14 in front of his parents' house. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of DM1 million.  </field>

<field name="text">In the trial on the kidnapping and murder of the Frankfurt millionaire Jakub Fiszman, the accused Rainer Koerppen denied any connection with the case. In his statement he instead incriminated his son Sven. Sven had confessed the crime to him, said the 49-year-old suspect. He himself had only buried the ransom and cleared all traces in order to protect his son and himself. Sven Koerppen, who is charged with aiding and abetting the crime, confessed to have kidnapped Fiszman together with his father, but said he did not know anything about the murder.  </field>

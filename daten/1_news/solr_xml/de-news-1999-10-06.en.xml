<field name="text">Foreign Minister Fischer criticized the advance of Russian troops into Chechnya, and appealed to Moscow to comply with the OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) code of conduct. The conflict can only be solved through political dialog, Fischer stressed before representatives of the OSCE in Vienna. Violence will only lead to further radicalization of the parties involved, he said. Meanwhile, Russian troops have taken positions in the north of the Caucasus republic. After six days of fighting, the provisional government in the Chechnyan capital of Grozny said no more of its troops were in the region. Russian Finance Minister Kasyanov announced that due to the continuing conflict in Chechnya, defense expenditures would increase by approximately 20% in the coming year.  </field>

<field name="text">Public health insurance companies are not required to pay for the replacement of amalgam dental fillings, according to a general ruling by the Federal Social Court. That mercury leached from such fillings can impair health has not been established conclusively by science, but is merely an unverified assumption. Since controversy continues among researchers regarding this matter, and no hard evidence has been presented, it is not the place of the court to take up the position of either side.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal cabinet has decided to send up to 100 medical personnel from the German Armed Forces to support the UN mission in East Timor, which is under the control of an international peace-keeping force. The soldiers are stationed in Darwin, Australia, and will fly heavily wounded persons out of East Timor with two Transall aircraft, and treat them at their base. The mission will be paid for out of the defense budget. If that is not sufficient to last to the end of 1999, resources from the federal budget will be used. In the first fire fight between pro-Indonesian militias and the peacekeepers, two militiamen were killed and two peacekeepers were wounded.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder gave the industry trade union IG Metall no promises regarding proposals for retirement at age 60. The Chancellor indicated that the model was basically sound, but at present could not be accomplished financially. Schroeder wooed the approximately 600 delegates at IG Metall's union conference, asking them for a fair evaluation of the government's action so far, which hadn't had negative social consequences, he said. IG Metall head Zwickel had previously withdrawn his threat to leave the "Alliance for Work" if the proposal for retirement at 60 went awry.  </field>

<field name="text">In the opinion of German Economic Institute (IDW) in Cologne, retirement at 60 is not a useful instrument in the fight against unemployment. Shortening people's total working lifetime will worsen the financial situation of social security, explained the Institute. In coming years, the number of employed persons will be reduced. Therefore, more and more workers would have to fund the old age pensions of an still higher number of pensioners. The industry think tank instead supported an increase in the ratio of active workers in the 55 to 64 age bracket.  </field>

<field name="text">Former SPD leader Lafontaine expressed himself in favor of an alliance between the SPD and the PDS even at the federal level. He has no problem with the PDS participating in the federal government, providing one could come to an agreement with it on a common policy, he wrote in his book "The Heart Beats Left", further excerpts of which were published today by the newspaper "Die Welt". The criticism of Lafontaine hasn't let up. Foreign Minister Fischer spoke of a political and personal tragedy. Nobel Prize winning author Grass advised Lafontaine to look for a more meaningful occupation.  </field>

<field name="text">The future of Transrapid, the troubled maglev rail system, remains uncertain. It appears that there is still no decision following a meeting by representatives of the government, German Rail, and industry in Frankfurt. At the meeting, the primary concern was how and if the system can be operated economically with a single rail line. According to an estimate of the German Institute for Economic Research, building even a single line will cost more than the 6.1 billion DM figure provided for in the red/green coalition agreement.  </field></doc></add>

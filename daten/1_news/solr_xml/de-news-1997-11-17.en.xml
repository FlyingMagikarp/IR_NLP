<field name="text">An as yet unknown number of tourists was killed during another terrorist attack in the upper Egyptian town of Luxor. The latest count is 78 victims, including German tourists. According to eyewitness reports, the slaughter went on for about 45 minutes. Initially, the terrorists (presumably Muslim fanatics) attacked a bus carrying Japanese tourists, killing them all with assault rifles. Subsequently they took hold of another bus with French, German and Swiss passengers. Again, all of them were killed. The terrorists are said to have then attacked with daggers further tourists within the temple area. According to Egyptian witnesses, police did not arrive until well after the shooting began. The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior claims all six terrorists were killed, but other reports mention 11 attackers, some of whom were said to have committed suicide.  </field>

<field name="text">Three days before the special European Union summit on employment policy is to begin, the German government again voiced its opposition against over-ambitious aims. In Brussels, federal ministers Waigel, Bluem, and Rexrodt jointly spoke out against fixing rigid aims for improving the labour market. Minister for Economy Rexrodt said the summit meeting had to face reality. Paper, he said, would not produce jobs. Employment policy had to be the responsibility of individual nations. The three German ministers have gone to the Belgian capital to join their colleagues from the other EU countries in laying the groundwork for the summit meeting.  </field>

<field name="text">The road has been paved for implementation of part-time jobs for older workers in the metal and electric industrial sectors. Employers and unions agreed to joint formulations regarding the disputed items. One of the points agreed on was the assurance of accumulated overtime bonus payments in case of the employer's bankruptcy. Also, overtime work that occurred previous to the beginning of the part-time status can be included in calculations. The Donaueschingen arbitration conceded the right to part-time work for employees after their 61st birthday. They can work for 2 years and stay homed for the 2 following years, receiving 82% of their last net wages over the course of 4 years. In Baden- Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, slight adaptations will have to be made, because some employees with higher gross wages could receive lower salaries than mandated by law.  </field>

<field name="text">Today, truck drivers all over the world protested against their work conditions. In Europe, unionized truck drivers rallied at border crossings against long working hours that cause accidents due to overtiredness. The protests partially blocked cross-border traffic, especially at the French borders. At the Europe Bridge connecting Kehl, Germany and Strasbourg, France one lane was temporarily blocked. In Germany, there were protests in 25 places according to the OeTV union. About 100 truck drivers participated in blocking the Austrian-Italian border at the Brenner pass. The truck drivers demand a limit of 48 working hours per week, a lower retirement age and better conditions in international traffic. The EU commission expressed its understanding for the protest. The authority called on trade unions and transportation companies to negotiate a working time regulation by the end of September. If the negotiations failed, the commission would submit a proposal.  </field>

<field name="text">The last official release of unemployment statistics before the general elections has further incited the election campaign. Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated that the figures showed a trend change on the job market. He expects that less than four million people will be unemployed in September. This was a sign that the reform policy of the government coalition was working. Also CSU and FDP called the changes on the job market encouraging. In contrast, SPD president Oskar Lafontaine said, there was never before such a high number of unemployed at the time of a general election as this year. The SPD would turn the elections into a plebiscite on the fighting of unemployment. Lafontaine said "The number of more than four million shows that the Kohl government must be voted out". Juergen Trittin and Gunda Roestel, executive spokespersons of Buendnis 90/Die Gruenen called the success news of the government "voter deception". The president of the Federal Employment Office, Bernhard Jagoda sees the slight improvement of the unemployment number as a sign for a country-wide change of trend at the job market. The Federal Employment Office reported today that the number of unemployed decreased by 39,000 to 4.095 million in August. The percentage declined from 10.7 to 10.6 percent. Jagoda stressed that he thought it is possible that the unemployment number could fall below the four million mark within the next two months if the job creation and education programmes could be upheld at the current level. As before, the situation in the East with 17.1 percent unemployed is worse than in the West with 9 percent. In Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria the unemployment increased slightly since July contrary to the federal trend.  </field>

<field name="text">Companies that take part in invitations to bid for public contracts will have more confidence in a fair proceeding after today's ruling of the Federal High Court. According to its decision, the price is the only legal base for awarding a contract among all bidders judged suitable. The city of Osnabrueck had not chosen the cheapest offer for building a sewage purification plant because they had judged another bidder more suitable for the contract. The city will now have to pay compensation to the bidder with the cheapest offer for lost revenues.  </field>

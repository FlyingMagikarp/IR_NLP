<field name="text">One day before the federal tax revenue estimation committee (Arbeitskreis Steuerschaetzung) convenes again, the partisan wrangling over what to do with a possible surplus (that is, higher tax revenues than previously projected) continues. The Parliamentary Secretary for the Finance Department, Barbara Hendricks, told the Bundestag in Berlin that the Opposition's calls for tax cuts were frivolous and populistic. She added that the Government would stick to its guns on planned austerity measures. The finance speaker for the Greens, Klaus Mueller, suggested that German residents were already less burdened by taxes than under the previous government of Helmut Kohl. The FDP, who had instigated the special session, accused the government of gouging the populace.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Government sees no reason to distance itself from the substance of the exhibition on the Wehrmacht (German army during the Nazi era). Some recently discovered factual errors, do nothing to diminish the basic content of the exhibition, as Deputy Minister for the Foreign Affairs Office, Ludger Volmer, emphasized during a Bundestag question period in Berlin. He said that given the wealth of photographic material, the number of incorrectly ascribed photos was small. The CSU insisted that the Wehrmacht exhibition not be shown in the United States, despite plans to the contrary.  </field>

<field name="text">In the view of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, China should not be publicly denounced for human rights violations. In Shanghai, Schroeder said that such problems should be dealt with in cooperative dialogue. He considers accusations and complaints to be counterproductive, but said he plans to touch on the subject of human rights when he meets with the Chinese leadership tomorrow in Beijing. Sources among journalists following the state visit indicate that business dealings worth a total of 6 billion DM will be signed in the presence of Schroeder and the Chinese President Jiang Zemin tomorrow.  </field>

<field name="text">The Premiers of the Eastern German states have come out against federal plans to tie together in a single package absolving the Eastern public health insurance companies of their debts and reforming the health-care system. Brandenburg's leader, Manfred Stolpe, following a meeting in Berlin with his counterparts, said that the debt-release was indeed necessary, but must not be tied to reforms to the entire system. Federal Health Minister Andrea Fischer has repeatedly stated that she intends to stick to the plan to make it part and parcel of the overall health reform scheme that the Western public health insurers be obliged to support their Eastern equivalents through a special one-time supplement of 1.3 billion DM. The Bundestag debates the bill tomorrow.  </field>

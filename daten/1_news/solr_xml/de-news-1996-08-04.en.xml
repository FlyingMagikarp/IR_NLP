<field name="text">In an ongoing bargaining struggle, the union for trade, bank and insurance employees HBV has threatened to broaden the token strikes if the employers side will not yield to the union's demands. HBV board member Wiedholt outlined the demands today in Duesseldorf, saying that the employers next step had to be the creation of a solid basis for resolving the conflict. In Nordrhein-Westfalen, the biggest affected area, work stoppages were again extended on this, a "long" Saturday [when shops are permitted to stay open longer than usual. HBV counted more than 2,000 employees laying down work. The HBV union demands a 5% wage increase for the roughly 3 million employees it represents as well as a compensation for the extended shopping hours.  </field>

<field name="text">The state premier of Bayern Edmund Stoiber (CSU) advocated an increase in consumer taxes. On Deutschlandfunk radio, Stoiber reasoned that taxation on consumption was too little, on income too much. He mentioned that direst taxes like the income tax needed to be lowered and consumer taxes like the value-added tax should be increased. A tax reform should help clear up the tax confusions so that the citizens could do their tax reforms themselves, he added. Finance Minister Waigel as well thought that an increase of the value-added tax as part of the tax reform was a feasible option, but warned against using this as the only funding for the reform. At the same time, Waigel ruled out that the reform would take place anytime before 1999.  </field>

<field name="text">Filing conflict-of-interest charges against the head judge of the Rome tribunal, both public prosecutors and joint plaintiffs want to obtain a new trial against the former SS officer Priebke. In Rome today, public prosecutor Scandura said this was the only way to open the trial again. If the Court of Cassation approves the charges, the verdict would be suspended. Judge Guistelli was quoted as saying before the trial that he expected Priebke to be acquitted. However, two charges of conflict-of-interest already failed during the proceedings. The military tribunal had found Priebke guilty of taking part in the execution of 335 Italian civilians in the Ardeatine caves, but ruled that the statute of limitations had expired.  </field>

Talking on South German radio, Pau reasoned that for such a coalition at this point there were neither political foundations nor public acceptance.

<field name="text">The weekly Bild am Sonntag reports that finance experts of CDU/CSU and FDP have agreed on the keystones of the 1999 tax reform. The lowest income tax rate will be 20 percent and the highest rate 40 percent. The commission wants to set the basics of the tax reform by next Wednesday. The coalition plans to approve the draft one week later. The tax cuts are to be financed by the abolishment of tax benefits.  After Christian Union and Liberals had compromised on the 1997 annual tax law the debate about the great tax reform has erupted again. Today, FDP faction leader Dorothee Solms said newspaper reports that the tax commission had already reached an agreement were wrong. Apparently, there are still arguments about the increase of the sales tax and the future income tax bracket. Therefore, it is questionable whether CDU, CSU, and FDP can table their bill as planned before Christmas.  </field>

<field name="text">Vice-president of the SPD Bundestag faction Guenter Verheugen is in favour of a coalition with Alliance90/Greens after the next general elections.

Also on ZDF television, Mr. Schlauch, Alliance90/Greens member of parliament, said his party did not need an SPD declaration for a coalition but wanted more tangible signals.  </field>

This was the least the employers want to achieve in view of the continuing crisis. As in this year, production in the construction industry is expected to decrease in 1997 by about 5% after inflation adjustment. This would presumably mean the loss of another 100,000 jobs. Eichbauer announced that his organization would return to the German Association of Employers Federation after the minimum wage issue had been clarified.  </field>

<field name="text">Ms. Wiczorek-Zeul, vice-president of the Social-Democrats, has accused the German government of stubbornness in the discussion of the reform of the Maastricht Treaty. It was time that the government gave up its opposition against including into the treaty the target of a high level of employment. Otherwise, it would be Bonn against the majority of the twelve [fifteen] member states. Ms. Wiczorek-Zeul also criticized her own party. The discussion about the introduction of the new European currency was small-minded.  The German Federation of Unions, DGB, has called upon the government to be more open to compromises regarding the European Monetary Union. The government's position was economic nonsense and counterproductive in employment policy. Countries that are in a light recession should be allowed a larger than 3 percent budget deficit. Here, the DGB shared the EU Commission's view.  </field>

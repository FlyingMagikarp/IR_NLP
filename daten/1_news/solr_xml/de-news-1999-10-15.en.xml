<field name="text">The 1999 Nobel Prize for Peace went to the organisation 'Medecins sans Frontieres', acknowledging their pioneering work in the humanitarian field in all continents. Since their establishment in 1971, more than 2000 volunteers helped out wherever there was a crisis, in more than 60 countries. There had been backers for two other candidates, the War Crimes Tribunal, and two Chinese dissidents. The Nobel Committee refuted claims that political pressure from Beijing had influenced their judgement.  </field>

<field name="text">For the first time the EU's heads of state, meeting at Tampere/Finland, discussed a future European judiciary. Apparently a vast majority backed Germany's proposals of 'seeding' a European public prosecutor's office, as well as setting up a European Police Academy. However, nothing concrete has been decided on so far. During the meeting, Chancellor Schroeder and British Prime Minister Blair agreed to back Turkey's application to become a potential EU-member. The EU also plans to fight the influx of refugees by following a common policy on asylum, and they will co-operate more vigourously as far as organised crime was concerned. One issue still is open: how to spread member-countries' widely varying burdens to achieve more fairness.  </field>

<field name="text">The Upper House (Bundesrat) took a first step towards reforming the justice system, by agreeing to arbitration for small claims before going to court. In the future, neighbours with a conflict will be able to go to court only after they have tried arbitration outside the court system. This is to rid the lower courts of some of their workload. The Upper House (Bundesrat) also asked for the states to get more responsibility for making laws. Saxony's head of state Biedenkopf was elected new president of the Upper House (Bundesrat). He will take over from Hesses's State Premier Koch on 1 November.  </field>

<field name="text">The coalition parties, too, were sceptical about Labour Minister Riester's and the Metalworkers' Union's brainchild for paying pensions at age 60. Head of the Greens parliamentary group Schlauch was against it, and spokesperson Roestel was sceptical, too. And some SPD-politicians as well as pension experts had their doubts. According to the Berlin newspaper DER TAGESSPIEGEL, Mr Riester had not asked for Chancellor Schroeder's opinion when he had masterminded the compromise, and the Greens had not been informed either. The newspaper quoted high-ranking government sources.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the newspaper STUTTGARTER ZEITUNG, Oskar Schindler's estate has been found at Hildesheim. Apparently the original 'list' is part of it, something that became famous by the movie "Schindler's List". There, company manager Schindler had listed numerous Jews as absolutely necessary for production at his Cracow ammunition factory. This scheme would have saved the lives of some 1200 Jews. When friends of Mr Schindler's disposed of some of his household items, they found the suitcase containing part of his estate.  </field></doc></add>

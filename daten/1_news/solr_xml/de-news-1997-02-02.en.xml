<field name="text">The CDU-Committee for the future of the social security systems discussed the pension reform today in Windhagen. Minister of Employment, Bluem, was presiding over the two-day conference. The basis was a report which was presented to the government by the pension committee. The committee suggested among other things to decrease the pension levels from 70 to 64 percent of the net wage by the year 2030. Pensions for child raising services will be financed by tax money from a new family plan agency. The contribution rate of 20.3 percent will decrease during the next few years and then increase to 23 percent. The suggestions are controversial among members of the CDU and especially its coalition partner FDP, yet they are supported by social politicians of the union parties.  </field>

<field name="text">The director of the Association of German Pension Insurance Agencies, Ruland, warned against a further decrease of the contribution rate for social security. Ruland told the radio station "Deutschlandfunk" that contributions can hardly by pushed under the 20 percent mark because otherwise the gap between pensions and welfare will become too small. Ruland attributed the current financial situation of social security to political mistakes. He emphasized that last year's limited contribution rate as well as the use of pension funds for not insurance related services are responsible for this situation. At the same time, he welcomed the introduction of a so-called family plan agency as a start to relieve social security.  </field>

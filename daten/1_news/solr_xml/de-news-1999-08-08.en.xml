<field name="text">Members of the CDU/CSU, as well as members of the SPD, and the FDP, have voiced their reluctance to violate Sundays as a day of rest. The German Industry and Trade Commission (DIHT) has called for stores to be allowed to set their own hours on workdays. According to the Commission, such a move could ease the urgency of the Sunday-shopping debate. The highest drama in the debate so far occurred today. About 100 shops were open for the second Sunday in a row in Halle, and the throngs of shoppers were met by protesting labour union members handing out pamphlets saying "Leave me in peace on Sundays". While protests have been growing all over the country, merchants in Halle announced record sales today. Shops in Dessau remained closed. The Kaufhof department store on the Alexanderplatz square in Berlin, which was the center of the Sunday offensive last week, also remained closed.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Finance Minister Hans Eichel has defended his savings plans against fierce criticism from trade unionists and the left wing of the SPD. Speaking at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the German Postal Union in Cologne, Eichel said that while the plan was a bitter pill to swallow, it was nonetheless essential medicine. He said he would not apologize for doing the clean-up work on the errors committed by the former government. Eichel also said it would be impossible to keep social services outside of the cuts, as around 40 percent of government expenditures were incurred there.  </field>

<field name="text">Giving ever-increasing inheritance wealth in Germany, more and more SPD and Green Party members are speaking out in favour of higher inheritance taxes. SPD social policy expert, Dressler, told Bild magazine that wealth acquired as a gift could not, on principle, be treated differently from wealth acquired through work. Lower Saxony's State Premier Glogowski insisted that any changes must not affect the small home-owner. The labour unions reject the entire suggestion.  </field>

<field name="text">Given the fierce battle going on in the electrical energy market, calls for a body to regulate the industry are becoming more insistent. SPD and Green politicians have come out in favour of an authority which would oversee the market, similar to the one which watches telephone rates. SPD energy expert, Scheer, justified the move, telling Bild magazine that there was the danger of the energy giants engaging in unfair practices to drive the smaller electrical providers out of business.  </field>

<field name="text">The Archbishop of Fulda, Dueba, is calling for a new discussion of participation by the Catholic Church in state-sanctioned pregnancy counselling. Only is June had the Council of German Bishops reached an agreement to conclude the certificate issued after pregnancy counselling with a sentence saying "This certificate may not be used in order to obtain an abortion". Dueba told the Welt newspaper that that was a labelling swindle, disobeying the Pope and threatening the credibility of the Church. Dueba also criticized the chairman of the Bishop's Council, Lehmann. He said that Lehmann initially also considered the agreed solution to be impossible, but his objections were gnawed away by his legal counsel.  </field>

<field name="text">Washington, USA. Last year, Germany was the second-largest exporter of arms in the world, second only to the United States. According to an American study, Germany sold abroad weapons worth approximately 5.5 billion US dollars. The United States topped that with over 7 billion dollars. The most weapons were bought by such countries as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirate, Malaysia, and Egypt. Compared to previous years, however, weapons sales are down significantly. The report indicates the cause for that change lies in the financial crisis in Asia, and financial problems in Third World countries.  </field>

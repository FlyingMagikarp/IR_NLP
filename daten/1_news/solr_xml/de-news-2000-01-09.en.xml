<field name="text">After months of rancour over the possible pensioning of 60-year-olds, the federal government, employers, and unions have taken a large step forward. They have agreed upon a compromise in early retirement. A visibly pleased Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said after the meeting that it was now up to the employers and unions to hammer out the details. A second breakthrough was an agreement to pursue job-creation-oriented and longer(er)-term wage policies. This will prevent the coming rounds of industry contract negotiations from becoming exclusively about more money, as they were threatened to if the Alliance for Work failed. The president of the employers' association, Dieter Hundt, also welcomed the agreement. Criticism was forthcoming, however, from the Central Association of German Trades, which said that the interests of small and medium contractors were ignored.  </field>

<field name="text">Paul Spiegel, a businessman from Duesseldorf, has been elected the new president of the German Central Jewish Council. The 62-year-old artists' agent received six of nine votes. He announced that he would take an active role in German politics, and would continue the work of his predecessor, Ignatz Bubis. "One of our primary problems is the work of integration. Our community has almost tripled in the last few years. And we want to help the Jewish congregations to achieve this integration", he said. The Central Jewish Council has represented Jews in Germany since 1950.  </field>

<field name="text">Europe is in the grip of an influenza virus. Germany and Italy have been added to the sick list. Worst hit, however, is Great Britain. The situation there has now been officially labelled an epidemic. Infection rates are still below those of last year, but the chief medical officer of the British government, Liam Donaldson, is calling the situation extremely serious. He said the numbers are in fact much higher than reported, and the peak of infection has not yet nearly been reached. He said that 3-4,000 people die of the flu every year in Britain - in large part because the health system itself has been ailing for years. He said that the number of intensive-care beds still empty across the country can be counted on one hand.  </field>

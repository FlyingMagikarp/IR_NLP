<field name="text">The coalition committee of Bremen's SPD/CDU state government met in Bonn tonight to decide on the state's position in Friday's Bundesrat vote on the "great surveillance scheme".  CDU insists on agreeing to the compromise solution voted by the Bundestag. Head of federal state government Schaerf (SPD), on the other hand, wants to impose protection against the proposed surveillance of all professionals with a legal right to refuse testimony. All 5 red/green state governments have already announced they would vote against the necessary constitutional amendment. This makes Bremen's votes decisive for obtaining the necessary two thirds majority.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bundestag with the votes of the government coalition voted down tonight a plan for improving the situation in the construction industry proposed by SPD. Representatives of FDP and the Union parties, in the course of a debate preceding the vote, declared that what was needed was basic structural changes rather than pure activism. The tax reform bill blocked by SPD would have been a decisive step towards improving conditions. SPD speakers accuse the coalition of dodging responsibility in the construction crisis. The SPD plan had asked for, among other things, decisive curbing of moonlighting, a procedural review of subsidies for housing construction financed on the open market as well as an increase in local government investments the building area.  </field>

<field name="text">Smoking will not, for the time being, be outlawed in Germany's public buildings and in working areas. A clear majority of the Bundestag in Bonn voted against a draft for protecting non-smokers. 336 Bundestag members voted against the inter-party draft. 256 members voted in favour and 34 abstained. Federal minister for health Seehofer, CSU, again came out against the proposal during the debate preceding the vote. For better protection of smokers and non-smokers, information is better than an outright ban, he said. The SPD vice-leader, Ms. Matthaeus-Maier, defended the proposal. She refuted warnings against supposedly enormous economical burdens. The draft would have penalised infringement of the anti-smoking law with fines up to DM 5,000.  </field>

<field name="text">The unemployed are satisfied with the effect of their nation-wide protest actions. "For a start, it was a total success, and we will certainly go ahead", a spokeswoman for the organising group proclaimed. All over Germany, tens of thousands of people went to the streets to vent their anger. Participants of a Berlin protest shouted "Arbeit fuer alle, sonst gibt's Krawalle" (Jobs for all, or blows will fall"). The protests were peaceful as a whole. In the morning, the chairman of the federal labour office Jagoda had announced a new negative record. The unemployed quota has risen to 12.6%. In East Germany, the rate is twice that of the old states. Parties in the Bundestag discussed their respective solution proposals for the labour market. There was no approximation of points of view.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the NDR radio magazine "Panorama", the ministry of the interior of Baden-Wuerttemberg subsidised a seminary in which a number of notorious extreme rightists took part. In today's edition of the magazine it was reported that - according to the proceedings of the meeting - the question of Polish war guilt was included in the discussions. A condemned rightist terrorist woman belonging to the group around neo-Nazi Roeder as well as several leading members of the (now banned) Viking youth organisation were among the 60 participants. According to "Panorama" the seminar was organised in 1996 by the West Prussian Traditional Association and included among state-subsidised events, although the Stuttgart ministry of the  interior had had its attention called in writing to several lecturers considered "problematic".  </field>

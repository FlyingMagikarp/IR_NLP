<field name="text">The unemployment rate in Germany remains at a record high. According to the Federal Labour Office, 4.35 million people were registered as unemployed in April, 130,000 less than in March. The unemployment rate went down from 11.7% to 11.3%. However, compared to April last year, the number of unemployed people increased by 380,000.  President of the Federal Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda said the economic growth was still too weak to turn around the trend on the labour market. The shortage of apprenticeships continues to be serious.  The government commented on the April figures as being a good sign and giving hope for improvement in the labour market situation. Social Democrats and the national trade union federation called the new figures an alarming sign and accused the government of inactivity.  </field>

<field name="text">The governing coalition has formally offered the Social Democrats negotiations of the planned pension reform. Employment Minister Norbert Bluem said after exploratory talks with the SPD, the basis of the negotiations should be the reform proposals of the two parties. It was important to ease the financial burden of pension schemes by payment cuts and budgetary rearrangements. SPD social expert Rudolf Dressler said today's meeting didn't bring any new results to this respect. The only progress was that now the SPD proposal will be discussed.  </field>

<field name="text">Teachers' associations and unions protested against the educational policies of Schleswig-Holstein's state government this afternoon. They criticise in particular the controversial plans for securing a sufficient teaching level in the long term. This would include more work for older teachers and merging classes. The Education Minister, Ms Birk (sp?), has defended the plans again since for the first time it would be possible to plan the teaching level on a long-term basis. She added that the increase in the work load of the teachers was unavoidable.  </field>

<field name="text">The State Interior Ministers will, contrary to earlier plans, not accompany Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on his visit to Bosnia. Almost all invited Interior Ministers canceled the trip. It was planned that the Minister would inform themselves in Sarajevo on Thursday about the facilities for returning war refugees. Interior Minister of Bavaria Rudolf Beckstein and his colleague in Lower Saxony, Mr Glogowski, said the trip would be useless if Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther was not taking part. Also, just a one-day trip will not yield any new findings. Mr Kinkel has criticised several times the deportation of Bosnian refugees from Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">Social-democratic mayor of Bremen Henning Scherf has called on his party to show closedness on the time schedule of the nomination of their candidate for the next general elections. Mr Scherf said on Deutschlandfunk radio the proposed date next spring looked perfectly right to him. State Premier Gerhard Schroeder still had to prove that he could again win the elections in Lower Saxony [later this year]. The Bremen mayor also warned his fellow party members not to guide themselves by the success of the British Social Democrats, and not to - as he put it - "talk the SPD into confusion". Instead it was necessary to concentrate on important challenges like the tax and the pension reform.  </field>

<field name="text">Banks have to credit transfers to their customers' accounts on the day they receive them, according to a decision of the Federal High Court in Karlsruhe. The judges ruled illegal the procedure of a bank that always credited incoming transfers one day later than it actually received them. According to the judges, this praxis disadavantages the customers too much. The Federal High Court, however, approved the delayed crediting of cheques.  </field></doc></add>

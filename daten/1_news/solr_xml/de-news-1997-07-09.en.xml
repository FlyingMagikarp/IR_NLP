<field name="text">The seventh civil division of the Regional Court in Bonn has rejected the complaint of 3 scientology members against the CDU. The 3 former CDU-members were booted out of the party by the CDU's federal party court. The reason given for that expulsion was that scientology's power structure and treatment of critics cannot be reconciled with the basic philosophies of the party. Scientology has already announced that, following an examination of the regional court's ruling, it will pursue further legal channels.  </field>

<field name="text">The president of the Frauenhofer Society, Warneke (sp?), expects a serious decrease in positions in heavy industry. Warneke told economic reporters last night that it would not be much longer before only 20 percent of the work force, rather than the current 40 percent, is needed to secure the material needs of the society. He said that the vast majority of jobs in the future would be in the service branch, although it was not clear how society would cope with the change-over. Warneke added that in the past, government and society had hindered innovation rather than helped it; however, research and development are the primary engine of economic growth.  </field>

<field name="text">Madrid, Spain. Federal Chancellor Kohl has expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the NATO summit in Madrid. Kohl said that the approval of memberships for Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary was a step toward more security in Europe. The signing of a basic agreement between NATO and Russia in Paris recently, the signing of a charter between NATO and Ukraine today, and the opening up of NATO to the realities of the near and immediate future represent a new era in European security, according to the Chancellor. Kohl also said that the membership negotiations with the 3 candidates must begin as soon as possible; he fully expects that Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary will be able to sit down at the alliance's conference table in time for NATO's 50th anniversary in April 1999. This will not be the last expansion of the organization, Kohl continued; the rejected candidacies of Romania and Slovenia especially must be given a second chance, and a partnership for peace must be advanced for all those still outside of the alliance. Kohl concluded that, in any case, no new graves must be opened in Europe.  </field>

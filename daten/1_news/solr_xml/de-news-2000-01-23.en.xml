<field name="text">Unknown people have spread a statement allegedly from former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

A speaker for the CDU however said that this statement did not originate from Kohl.  This was also confirmed by Kohl's office. The statement, which had been sent by fax to several news agencies, said that Kohl would be willing to reveal the names of the donors before a committee.  This committee would have to be made up of high-ranking individuals, such as Federal President Johannes Rau and the President of the Bundestag, Mr. Thierse.  </field>

<field name="text">The Finance scandal in which the CDU finds itself continues to grow. The ARD television channel claims that there is still more wrong doing in conjunction with the sale of Leuna-Werke to the French government owned company, Elf Acquitaine.  Paris supposedly gave 30 million DM to the CDU's election coffers, a financial shot in the arm from Kohl's friend, the late, Ex-President Francois Mitterand.  Helmut Kohl immediately denied the report.  He denounced it as having been totally fabricated, lies and called it a high point in the smear campaign against him.  It became known as recently as December that important documents on Leuna had been mislaid in the Chancellor's office during Kohl's term.  In Berlin, the Presidium of the CDU is dealing with the final report of the review of the Union's finances.  </field>

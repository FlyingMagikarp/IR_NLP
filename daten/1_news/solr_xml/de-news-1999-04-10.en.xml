<field name="text">Inclement weather has again severely hindered NATO combat aircraft in Yugoslavia from bombing the planned targets.  According to a NATO official in Brussels, a large number of missions were either interrupted or not implemented at all.  He also noted that combat aircraft had destroyed a radio station in Pristina. The stations were part of a military communications system, which was the actual target. He added that cruise missiles had been used to eliminate fuel depots and factories. In the afternoon in Belgrade, air raid alarms sounded again after a brief all-clear.  </field>

<field name="text">According to Federal Foreign Minister Fischer, the air strikes against Yugoslavia will continue. The attacks will continue until every citizen in Kosovo is assured a peaceful and secure existence, he added.  At the same time, Mr. Verheugen, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, stated that the federal government will continue to pursue its original policy and no ground troops will be sent into Kosovo.  In Bonn, there is increasing support for the introduction of NATO ground troops. However, the opposition as well as the vast majority of government officials is decidedly against the use of ground troops. In an interview with "Der Spiegel," Chancellor Schroeder attempted to put his critics in their place.  He said that there was a moral imperative to uphold what is right and to reach the goals that have been set.  He stressed that pacifism was not an answer to genocide. However, he does not wish to be known as a chancellor of war.  </field>

<field name="text">A NATO spokesman in Brussels called the air strikes a success. He stated that the bombings had done a great deal of damage to Yugoslavia. Since the military operations began, more than 150 large targets have been hit and damaged. However, NATO should not yet discontinue the air strikes, he said. The general feeling in Brussels is that only President Milosevich can put an end to this process.  The state of the ethnic Albanians isolated in Kosovo remains unclear. Reports that twenty women had been carried off and murdered could not be confirmed by NATO. This was also true of a report that a large number of women had been raped by Serbian troops. The NATO spokesman was only able to verify that the refugees which cross the borders daily had said they had witnessed such atrocities.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Minister of Development, Heidemarie Wiczorek-Zeul, flew to Albania today to learn about the fate of Kosovo refugees. She wanted to visit the area to gain perspective on German and international emergency measures.  The emergency organizations in Bonn are focusing on supporting the countries adjacent to Kosovo in their efforts to take in refugees. The vice prime minister of Albania thanked Ms. Wiczorek-Zeul for the financial assistance from Germany. 35 million marks have been earmarked as emergency aid, with an additional 35 million marks offered by the minister today. Wiczorek-Zeul is well aware, however, that such a sum is not nearly enough to get one of the largest refugee crises since World War II under control. The minister emphasized that private funding campaigns and donations would also be needed. The Albanian vice prime minister seconded her view.  </field>

<field name="text">The heads of state agreed during their meeting in Tampere, Finland that the European union continue to be push forward the idea of a common European judiciary. This would ensure that any legal decisions would also apply in other EU countries and strengthen the cooperation between countries in fighting organized crime and money laundering. The leaders want to agree upon the most important minimum rules by the year 2004. However, many member states do not want to grant rights to a common European public prosecutor's office.  Chancellor Schroeder pointed out that the meeting in Tampere dealt with one of the largest integration projects after the creation of the common market, the Euro and border control reductions. The leaders also agreed to discuss creating a common European asylum system. The heads of state agreed yesterday to negotiate with six countries about their joining the EU.

<field name="text">The executive spokeswoman for the Green party, Antje Radcke, feels her party is facing an existential crisis. Radcke said at the party conference in Magdeburg that she feels the Greens have lost sight of their vision. In her opinion, Green policy-making has up to now been characterized by negotiations without an overarching plan. In front of approximately ninety delegates from the party committee, she called for a new "green message" from the Green party. The head of the parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Rezzo Schlauch, said the real problem is that the opposition in Berlin is being blamed for all of the crises.  Schlauch said party members should look forward and show solidarity instead of allowing the Union and PDS to stand for the social conscience of the nation. Other speakers criticized the disunity of the Greens.  The party committee intends to discuss program topics as well as debate about structure reform. The debate is supposed to give the party a stronger focus, but no decisions will be will made. The Green delegates adopted a resolution to support the federal government's savings package with a majority vote. They think it is a good idea to reduce expenses in the federal budget by 30 billion Marks, but they admit they made errors when negotiating for the savings package. The delegates also decided to implement a general safeguard against poverty amongst the elderly, which is the only thing that would make limiting pension payments acceptable.  </field>

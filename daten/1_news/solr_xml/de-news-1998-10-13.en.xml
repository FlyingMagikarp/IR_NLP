Next Friday, the Bundestag (Germany's lower house of parliament) will vote on the question whether German forces would take part in a NATO action [in Kosovo]. This question is rather disputed within Buendnis90/ The Greens, the expected junior partner in chancellor-designate Gerhard Schroeder's new government, though the issue has been "dedramatized" within the party, according to parliamentary party spokesperson Joschka Fischer. After the Yugoslav Presidents's giving in [to international pressure] the situation had changed. Mr Fischer said the Greens had to make nonetheless a difficult decision. It was, however, impossible that Germany fell out of solidarity within NATO. Several left-wing politicians of The Greens stressed that a military action by NATO within clear UN mandate would violate international law and hence unacceptable.  </field>

<field name="text">In connection with the charity incident of the state-owned "Suedwestdeutsche Verkehrs-AG" (South-West Traffic Ltd, SWEG) new accusations have been brought up against its chairman, the minister of transport, Mr Schaufler. Therefore, in his position as president of the tourism association of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Mr Schaufler has apparently taken a five-digit amount out of the account in anticipation of an upcoming fund-raising drive. Because the money were not returned afterwards, the SWEG asked for a corresponding donation, to basically fill the hole again. In connection with two further donations to the SSV Reutlingen sports club and a private audience given by pope John Paul II, the public prosecutor's office in Offenburg is now also investigating against Mr Schaufler. Mr Schaufler said that he is calmly awaiting the preliminary proceedings.  </field></doc></add>

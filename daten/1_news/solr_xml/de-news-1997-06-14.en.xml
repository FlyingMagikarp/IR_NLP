<field name="text">The spokesperson for the leadership of the Green Coalition, Mr. Trittin, charged the Coalition partners, the CDU and the FDP, with blocking each other.  He said that it was impossible to exclude tax increases, limit the new debt ceiling to 3 percent and introduce the Euro, all at the same time.  The federal government would have to make a decision in this matter here and now.  </field>

<field name="text">The head of the CSU, Mr. Waigel and the Minister President of Bavaria, Mr. Stoiber, have demonstrated their unity in the face of internal disagreements about the Euro and Bonn's budget problems. As main speakers at the district meeting of the CDU in Swabia and Upper Franconia, they avoided verbal confrontations.  Mr. Stoiber emphasized that he and Mr. Waigel were in total agreement on matters of stability.  The Federal Minister for Finance made a similar statement.  Theo Waigel obviously enjoyed the minutes of applause given to him by the approximately 200 CSU-delegates. Even before he actually began his speech, Mr. Waigel referred briefly to the supposed differences between him and Mr. Stoiber.  He cared little about all that, Mr. Waigel said, and then began to go through all the topics which had been the objects of controversy. Concerning the Euro: As far as he was concerned, convergence was an absolute priority; he was for clear criteria of stability and, he continued, only one figure was contained in the treaty. Postponement was not up for discussion, he added.  And then Mr. Waigel also commented on the reevaluation of the gold reserves. Only the timetable was a matter of disagreement between him and the Federal Bank, he said, but as far as the evaluation itself was concerned, he had always been in agreement with the Federal Bank.  Internal policies also played a role in Mr. Waigel's address.  The CDU would not allow a decontrol of drugs like the one planned in Schleswig-Holstein.  And alluding to the murder of seven-year-old Natalie, he remarked that the protection of victims was to be deemed more important than the perpetrator's claim on re-socialization. This was the exact tenor of his remarks.  </field>

<field name="text">The president of the Federal Alliance of German Industry. Mr. Henkel has expressed his opposition to any consideration of giving preference to those areas of tax reform which would first place a burden on businesses.  Mr. Henkel told the KOELNER EXPRESS that even the original concept of the government would bring no relief to businesses but be of benefit only to workers.  Still the model had been supported because of its effect as a signal.  But if this were to become a reform which would make the economy pay even more, support might waver.  Mr. Henkel expressed his categorical opposition to postponing the European monetary reform.  He expressed the opinion that it had been a mistake to allow pressure to establish the 3 percent limit to prevail in determining the debt criterion.  He said it was better to attain 3.2 percent with sound bookkeeping than to attain 3 percent with tricks.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Architects' Convention fears that the future of the profession will be endangered by the guidelines of the EU.  The president of the group, Mr. Erler, told DEUTSCHLANDRADIO BERLIN since, in the future, architects would be licensed to practice their profession in all of Europe, there would be large mergers of firms which would work internationally.  Mr. Erler criticized that small firms would then no longer have a chance.  To be sure, he continued the EU guidelines were pursuing the proper goal but putting them into practice would be problematic.  He added that the commission procedure would become more complicated in direct ratio to the amount of detail contained in the rules stated in national law.  </field>

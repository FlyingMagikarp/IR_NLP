<field name="text">In the opinion of the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Oscar Lafontaine, the proposals made by both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democratic Party regrading pension insurance reform are relatively similar. On the ZDF TV station, Mr. Lafontaine attributed the breakdown in negotiations to differences of opinion within the governing coalition itself. He continued that he is uncertain whether Chancellor Kohl has enough standing to be able to reach an agreement with the SPD without the Free Democratic Party. The Chairman of the SPD is advocating a gradual sales tax increase to compensate for lowering pension contributions, but he did not give exact numbers. Mr. Beck, the State Premier of Rhineland-Palatinate, had proposed an increase in sales tax by three percent by the year 1999.  </field>

<field name="text">The coming year might start off with renewed record unemployment highs. Economic experts fear that five million people could be without employment. Professor Pfeffighoven told the weekly paper "Bild am Sonntag" that this number might be even higher if the weather is unusually cold in January and February. He said that an important reason for this record high is the fact that tax reform failed to materialize and that investment in the German economy continue to be weak.  German Minister of Economy Rexrodt of the FDP also does not rule out the possibility that the jobless figures could rise to five million next year. Mr. Rexrodt told the Berlin-Brandenburg radio station "Inforadio" that he does not expect to make significant progress in reducing unemployment in 1998. However, he said that he is of the opinion that the turning point has been reached.  </field>

<field name="text">German relief organization Welthungerhilfe (World Hunger Aid) has expressed its disappointment over the result of the UN World Food Summit in Rome. Mr. Hausmann, secretary-general of Welthungerhilfe said in Bonn hunger and under-nourishment of 840 million people could not be fought with noncommittal declarations of intent. Thus, the chance had been missed to solve the hunger problem, which is primarily caused by politics. Hausmann criticized especially that every government was free to decide whether to accept the action plan passed in Rome. The conference, which is wrapping up today, has passed a plan aiming at reducing the number of starving people by half within twenty years.  </field></doc></add>

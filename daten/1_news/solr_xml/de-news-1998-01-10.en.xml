<field name="text">The federal board of the CDU has unanimously rejected the idea of a grand coalition following the federal elections in September. At the same time, the CDU leaders voiced their opposition to a loaning of party votes to the FDP. Following the CDU board's twoday seclusion meeting, its secretary general, Mr. Hintze, noted that his party was optimistic that the FDP would again manage to take the necessary five per cent of the votes. He added that the FDP can and must reach this goal without help. At the same time, Mr. Hintze cautioned not to take the comments of CDU parliamentary group leader Schaeuble to mean a step toward a coalition with the SPD. Schaeuble had said in an interview that he would not consider it a national tragedy if the federal elections did not yield a result that pointed to a grand coalition.  </field>

<field name="text">Buendnis 90/The Greens are meeting today and tomorrow for their small party conference. The sole subject of the conference is the discussion and possibly change of the current draft of the election manifesto. During the preparation of the pamphlet, there had been heated discussions regarding several points of the program, both among the public and within the party. Especially the question if peace missions, as the current one to Bosnia, are legitimate had been a source of controversy between the realist and fundamentalist wings of the party. The current draft rejects missions of this sort in principle. The party leadership announced that this section was likely to remain in the program, since its critics were going to refrain from further attacks. More controversial is the question of the mineral oil tax. The plan to increase the price of gasoline to DM 5 per within the next ten years is met with criticism by several state groups. Especially many East German party members consider this demand to mean political suicide. The additions and changes to be completed this weekend are all in the form of recommendations for the upcoming federal party conference in March. At that time, the final version of the manifesto will be passed.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government and the Jewish Claims Conference have found an agreement regarding compensations to Jewish victims of the NS in Eastern Europe. The newspaper "Berliner Tagesspiegel" reports that from 1999 to 2002, Germany is going to pay 50 million Marks annually to the Jewish organization. The Jewish Claims Conference will then distribute the funds among an estimated 18,000 eligible applicants. If the numbers are correct, each victim could receive about 250 Marks per month. Prerequisites for eligibility are that the survivors of the holocaust have not received any other compensations, can demonstrate economic hardship, and were part of a minority in a concentration camp or ghetto. After the re-unification, the federal republic had paid large sums of money to most Central and East European countries, most of which did never reach the victims. The federal government continues to refuse to establish regular compensation payments to individuals.  </field>

<field name="text">The FDP plans to introduce stricter conditions for social aid. FDP Secretary General Westerwelle said in an interview with the "Bild Zeitung" that in principle, some sort of reciprocation needed to be required. For example, welfare recipients will in the future be required to produce proof that they are attempting to improve their situation by seeking job training. Mr. Westerwelle added that only those who are truly unable to work, due to medical or other reasons, will be exempt. In his words, the weak need to be protected from the lazy.  </field>

<field name="text">The governmental commissioner for non-citizens, Ms. Schmalz- Jakobson of the FDP, has criticized the treatment of non-citizens by the CSU.

<field name="text">Health Minister Fischer again defended the planned health care reform against criticism. Introducing her bill in Bonn, the Green party politician criticized the Physician's Association of consciously spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt to their patients. Those who oppose the planned reorganizations must also point to alternatives, she said. The intention is to couple health care spending to the overall growth of wages in the future. A global budget will determine the upper limit on insurance payments, and the role of the family doctor will be strengthened. Furthermore there will be list of approved drugs for which insurance will pay. Vilmar, president of the Federal General Medical Council, speaking on ZDF television this evening said if the proposal is implemented in its current form, strikes could not be ruled out. Vilmar called the reform plan unrealistic. Rising life expectancies and medical advances will lead to a need for more treatment in the future. Therefore, a global budget tied to income cannot guarantee the necessary care in the long term, he said.  </field>

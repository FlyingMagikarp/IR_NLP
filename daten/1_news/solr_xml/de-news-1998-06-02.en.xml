<field name="text">Federal Environment Minister Angela Merkel has met with her state colleagues to discuss a ten-point programme to increase the safety of nuclear waste transports. The measures are to prevent that safety thresholds are passed during CASTOR transports. Several states led by an SPD government did not send their subject ministers but high-ranking officials. Environment Minister Juettner of Lower-Saxony explained that all conditions for a decision were lacking for a talk with Ms. Merkel. The Hesse Minister Hinz said she was going to have explored whether utility company RWE has knowingly violated radiation protection by-laws. When the crisis meeting closed last night no new measures had been adopted. Federal Environment Minister Merkel stressed that further steps would only be initiated after a report by the states. The report is due in two weeks. The environment ministers of several states announced at the meeting to present measuring protocols about the nuclear transports of the past years. Ms. Merkel declared that there was no evidence for doubts against the reliability of nuclear power companies.  </field>

<field name="text">The retail sector in western Germany is heading towards a strike after several collective bargaining rounds without results. The executive of the DAG union resolved today that a ballot for a strike be held in five states. The regional bargainings in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Saarland have also been tabled without result. In the Southwest the employees of four companies went on strike. The ballots started in North Rhine-Westphalia. In Hesse, Schleswig-Holstein and Saarland the workers will vote on a strike later this week. The DAG and HBV unions consider the employers' offer of 1.5% wage increase insufficient. The unions also reject the demand to pay contracted unemployed workers lower wages.  </field>

<field name="text">Apparently, the Nazis have used the gold of their victims at a larger extent than known so far to finance World War II. The precious metal was usually exchanged for money in Switzerland to buy important raw materials and supplies in other countries. This is the conclusion of a report by the US Foreign Ministry. It says that gold, then worth $300 million, was paid to Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Argentina, and Turkey. Three quarters of the money was passed through the Swiss National Bank.  </field>

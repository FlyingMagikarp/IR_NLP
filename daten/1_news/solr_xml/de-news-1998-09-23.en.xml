<field name="text">When Germany takes its turn in the presidency of the European Union, during the first six months of 1999, it will work to establish a new foundation for cooperation with Iran. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel made that assurance to his Iranian counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi, at a meeting on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York. Kinkel subsequently told journalists that Teheran was especially interested in discussion cooperation in matters of energy, the environment, combatting the illegal drug trade, as well as the refugee problem. Kinkel also welcomed an announcement by Iranian President Mohammed Khatami that the writ issued by the late revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini for the execution of writer Salman Rushdie could now be considered nullified; Kinkel called it a step in the right direction.  </field>

<field name="text">The German electrical companies have pointed out the a high price would have to be paid if the country moved quickly away from using nuclear energy. The state would have to pay damages in the billions of D-Marks, and consumers could expect higher electrical bills, according to the managing director of the Association of German Electrical Works, Eberhard Meller, speaking in Frankfurt. Earlier in Bonn, environmental groups had reiterated calls to abandon nuclear energy immediately, saying that the risks associated with it were so great that Germany could not afford to wait five or ten more years. The SPD environment critic, Mueller, announced that her party would act quickly to take the first steps towards a nuclear-free power grid if the SPD formed the government after next week's federal election.  </field>

<field name="text">Following Volkswagen's lead, the Siemens corporation now also plans to establish a restitution fund of 20 million DM for those forced into labour there during World War II. The company announced that the money would be directed to those who needed it quickly and without a lot of red tape. A Siemens spokesman in Munich said that the fund, which was to be administered by independent persons and organizations, could be supplemented if the initial amount proved to be insufficient. Siemens has placed the number of what it calls "workers against their own will" employed there in 1944 at about 50,000.  </field>

<field name="text">According to a report in the Berlin newspaper "Der Tagesspiegel", the former East German National People's Army experienced hundreds of occurrences of right-wing extremism. The authority overseeing East German security files (Gauck-Behoerde) has found evidence to that effect in the files of the former East German Ministry for State Security, as the newspaper will publish in tomorrow's edition. Conscripts and officers apparently organized celebrations and shouted Nazi slogans on Hitler's birthday. Conflicts between right-wing and other soldiers are also supposed to have occurred. The report also speaks of similar occurrences within the secret police force, the Stasi.  </field>

<field name="text">Four days before the federal election, a dispute over pensions for former postal workers has broken out. Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel has refuted a newspaper report claiming that, due to accounting errors, the state would face a shortfall of billions of D-Marks beginning in 1999. Waigel called the article so much election-campaign hot air, and said it only served to confuse the people. The Finance Ministry added that it had already been announced in July that 6 million DM of shares in the privatized German Post corporation would be sold off in order to secure the pensions. Finance critics for the SPD and the Green Party accused Waigel of renewed sleight-of-hand.  </field></doc></add>

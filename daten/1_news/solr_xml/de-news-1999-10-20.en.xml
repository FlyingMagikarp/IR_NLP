<field name="text">The number of jobs in the German coal industry is to be cut faster than previously planned. The Ruhrkohle company in Essen announced today that 24,000 jobs will be cut in the next three years. The chairman of the company, Gerhard Neipp, said that by 2005 36,000 employees will remain, as agreed to in the coal industry compromise deal of 1997. At that point, there would only be 10 operating coal mines left, producing approximately 26 million metric tonnes, as Naib emphasized. He said the reasons for accelerating the job cuts were lower prices on the world market, and falling sales.  </field>

<field name="text">Germany will deliver a Leopard II tank to Turkey to try out. The Federal Security Council in Berlin made the decision. It added, however, that this delivery does not mean that a decision has been made about the Turkish request to purchase 1000 such tanks. The arms deal would be worth about 15 billion DM. No decision is due until 2001. The controversial proposal, made by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, was apparently supported by Economic Minister Werner Mueller, and Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping, while Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and Development Aid Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul opposed it.  </field>

<field name="text">The Greens and the CDU/CSU have strongly criticized the plan to deliver a Leopard II tank to Turkey. A statement released by the Green federal caucus charged that the move contradicted the spirit of the Coalition Agreement between the Greens and the SPD, in which human rights were made the most important factor in arms export decisions. The CDU/CSU charged that the federal government was not pursuing a consistent course vis-a-vis Turkey. CDU Bundestag member, Karl Lamers, complained that on the one hand, the government was pushing for Turkish membership in the European Union, while on the other hand it did not consider the country trustworthy of the full delivery of 1000 tanks.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Families Minister Christine Bergmann plans to introduce a legal amendment to make it possible for women and men to work part-time at the same time, while on family leave. Bergmann told the Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspaper that family leave must be structured so that family and career could be better reconciled. Mothers and fathers will be able to take family leave at the same time, according to the plan. The 19 hours of work per week allowed by law while on family leave will also be increased to 30.  </field></doc></add>

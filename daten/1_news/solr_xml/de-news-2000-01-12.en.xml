<field name="text">CDU Party Chair Wolfgang Schaeuble intends to stand for that office once again. From Berlin, a speaker for Schaeuble made it clear that the party leader intends to stand for reelection at the Christian Democratic party congress in April. The CSU faction in the Bundestag asked its sister party for further explanations regarding its ongoing donation scandal. In particular, Schaeuble's statement regarding the 100,000 DM donation from arms-dealer lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber raises questions. Various leading politicians within the CDU have thrown their support behind the leader. Von Beuss, faction leader of the Christian Democrats in Hamburg, however, indicated in a newspaper interview that Schaeuble can be replaced. The CDU and CSU have a lot of good people, he said. CSU politician Gauweiler was quoted by the newspaper "Augsburger Allgemeine" as saying that Schaeuble would do a great service to all by resigning quickly. The "Berliner Zeitung" newspaper reported that SPD party leader Schroeder is preparing for a change in the CDU leadership. The Chancellor expects that the State Premier of Saxony, Biedenkopf, will take over from Schaeuble. Meanwhile, the television program "Kontraste" on the ARD network reported on a diary containing notes by Schreiber. The diary refers to frequent contacts between Schreiber and the treasurer of CDU at that time, Baumeister.  </field>

<field name="text">The regional party organization of the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein received approximately 165,000 DM during the 90's from a special account belonging to then party head Helmut Kohl. A speaker for the national party organization in Berlin said that 65,000 DM of that sum had been correctly recorded in the party books. The additional 100,000 DM had been received in cash by local party chief Henning, who passed away last year. This amount was part of the approximately 1 million DM that the federal parliamentary faction of the CDU had transferred to the rest of the party. 100,000 DM are said to have been funneled to the Christian Democrats in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in this way. From Kiel, CDU Secretary-General Vadekohl (sp?) explained that the apparently related monies that had been paid out had not been received by his party organization. Meanwhile, the administration of the Bundestag has asked the Hessian CDU to account for the origin of almost 13 million DM which had been received between 1989 and 1996 through anonymous bequests. Preliminary investigations by state prosecutors are already underway.  </field>

<field name="text">The Green party is looking at a possible change in its national leadership this summer. Kuenast, leader of the Green party faction in the Berlin state parliament, and her colleague from Baden-Wuerttemberg, Kuhn, have given notice that they would like to stand for both Speaker positions at the special party congress in June. However, they want the separation of office and mandate annulled first. [The Green Party constitution currently requires Green members of the Bundestag to resign their seats before taking up a post in the party leadership, and vice-versa.] Current office holders Radcke and Roestel have left open the issue of whether the election will be a contested one.  </field>

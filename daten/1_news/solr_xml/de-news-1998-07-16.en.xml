<field name="text">Politicians don't tire of praising nursing care insurance as a successful additional mainstay of social security. Not so the Mutual Welfare Society. In their opinion. an urgent review of nursing care insurance is in order because existent laws disregard the needs of recipients. The Society's Bonn chapter said that clean and well-fed was the reality of homes for the aged and the handicapped, that are under increasing financial pressure. Hardly any time remains for necessary psychological care, says the Society's general manager Werner Hesse-Schiller. The Society proposes a one level upgrading of persons with senile dementia so nurses could dedicate more of their time to them. This would not constitute a financial problem for the nursing care insurance office, as they have at this date a surplus of DM 8 billion in the till. Also, the Mutual Welfare Society demands reduction of the office's administrative cost. They say a reform in this direction is overdue.  </field>

<field name="text">CSU goes on discussing around the speed limit issue. CSU vice secretary general Joachim Herzog said in Munich that the declaration of SPD leaders saying the party opposes the Green party's demand for 100 km limit on the Autobahn and 30 km within city limits just could not be believed. In fact, a draft law proposal by red/green state governments was before the Bundesrat ever since late June. The quick reaction of SPD's candidate for the chancellorship Gerhard Schroeder and party general manager Franz Muentefering, declaring that SPD was strictly against a 100 km speed limit on the Autobahn, referring to a demand voiced by the Green fraction spokeswoman on traffic affairs, Gila Altmann, ten days ago, was totally untrustworthy, said Hermann during a press conference at Munich's SPD state headquarters. On June 25th, the red/green governments of Hamburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein and  Hesse hat submitted a joint proposal to the Bundesrat. The other states were taken totally by surprise, and a discussion date had been set for September 10th. Ins September, the staes would have to put the cards on the table.  </field>

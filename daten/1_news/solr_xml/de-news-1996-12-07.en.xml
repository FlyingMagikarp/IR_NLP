<field name="text">Following the affair surrounding private investigator Maus, the vice president of the Bundestag, Mr. Hirsch of the FDP, demanded that the government issue a precise job description for the coordinator of the secret service, Schmidtbauer. In an interview with the newspaper "Volksstimme am Sonntag," Hirsch agreed that Schmidtbauer had achieved great success as far as humanitarian work was concerned. However, Hirsch said, Schmidtbauer was now increasingly assigned tasks that conflicted with his duty as the supervisor of the secret service. Hirsch added that no matter how competently the chancellor set the guidelines, the minister in charge should be the one solely responsible for foreign policy, and should report solely to the parliament. If these basic conditions were not met, the government would become erratic, said Hirsch. He added that a parliamentary control commission will review the case of private investigator Maus next week.  </field>

<field name="text">Physicians who are members of health plans would like to also be able to bill their patients directly in the future. The chair of the federal association of physicians, Schorr, outlined this proposal at a meeting of representatives for his organization. The proposal would allow physicians to choose whether to bill their patients or the health insurance company. The patients would then have to apply for a refund from the insurance company. Schorr criticized the spending limits for medications and warned that a wave of bankruptcies among physicians was imminent. The physicians' organization fears that they will have to exceed their budget by more than four billion Marks, in order to serve their patients properly. The new laws stipulate that this money be deducted from the physicians' salaries.  </field>

<field name="text">Two suspected members of the terrorist organization RAF appear to plan to turn themselves in to German officials, the Hamburg news magazine "Der Spiegel" reports. The magazine elaborates that Barbara Mayer and Sabine Callsen, whose names are on the current wanted list of the federal criminal police agency, plan to turn themselves in, soon. However, the two are still waiting for the outcome in the case of RAF member Seitler. Barbara Mayer has been on the federal criminal police wanted list since 1984. She is suspected to have participated in the attack on the prison construction in Weiterstadt, Hesse, in March 1993. Like Barbara Mayer, also Sabine Callsen is considered to be one of the core members of the RAF. The federal criminal police suspects that she participated in two bombing attacks in Hamburg. There are also reports of new contacts to a third suspected RAF terrorist, Andrea Martina Klump, currently living in Peru. For personal reasons, she is unlikely to return. A warrant for the arrest of Klump and Christoph Seitler had been issued following the attempted murder of Alfred Herrhausen, the chief executive officer of the "Deutsche Bank." Two weeks ago, Seitler took advantage of the so-called "retirement program" and turned himself in. The program allows those who choose to, to leave behind their criminal past, provided that they renounce terrorism. After many hours of questioning, the 38-year-old has now been released. He denies ever having been a member of the RAF. The controversial retirement program is now being continued, since the Mayer and Callsen are planning to turn themselves in.  </field>

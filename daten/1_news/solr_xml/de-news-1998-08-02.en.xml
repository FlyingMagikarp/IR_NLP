<field name="text">The plans of SPD's candidate for Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, to quit atomic energy have attracted criticism. The Federal Minister for the Environment, Ms. Merkel, said in Bonn that Schroeder's plans were absurd as regards both security policy and environmental policy. The news magazine "Der Spiegel" had reported that should they win the election the SPD would close down the six oldest atomic power plants as soon as possible and would negotiate closure dates for the remaining thirteen. The SPD wants arguments about the transport of atomic waste to be brought to a speedy conclusion, to avoid compensation claims being issued by the energy companies. Ms. Merkel criticized the idea, saying that if the plans were put into action, state-of-the-art technology would have to be be run down and phased out. The chairman of Preussen-Elektrik [Prussian Electric Company], Mr. Harich, has already threatened to submit a claim for compensation. According to the tabloid "Bild", he said he would have no other choice if the nuclear power stations were closed down sooner than made economic sense.  </field>

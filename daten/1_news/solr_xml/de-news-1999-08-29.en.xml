<field name="text">Despite widespread protests, Federal Labour Minister Walter Riester and SPD caucus leader Peter Struck do not expect any changes to the pension plans of the red-green Coalition. Struck told Deutschlandfunk radio that he sees no other way than to adjust pensions by de-indexing them for a period of two years. (Until now, pension rates have been tied to the current wage agreement in retirees' former industry.) Riester told the newsmagazine "Der Spiegel" that he had had all of the alternatives carefully examined, and that the results showed that the only solution to the pension problem was the one he had suggested.  Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wants the pension plan to be presented to the Bundesrat together with his government's proposed savings package. Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber reiterated his criticism of the plans. He complained in Focus magazine that billions of Marks in debt were being downloaded on the states and municipalities. He also charged that the savings package would do nothing to create jobs, and would punish commuters. The president of the Federal Association for German Industry, Hans-Olaf Henkel, has also criticized the proposed pension reform. In a newspaper interview, he said that financing pensions by increasing the eco-tax was a monstrous idea. Overall, however, Henkel supports the government's drive to cut spending, and is calling for further steps to reduce the country's mountain of debt.  </field>

<field name="text">The president of the German Central Bank, Hans Tietmeyer, has called for corrections to the pension system. He told the newspaper "Die Welt" that the generation of those paying into the system is shrinking all the time, while the number of those drawing pensions is constantly growing. He said that if changes were not made, the expenses would increase explosively. Tietmeyer therefore called for adjustments to be made that reflect the demographic trends.  </field>

<field name="text">More and more Green politicians are calling for a clearer profile for their party. At meetings in Leipzig and Berlin, they came out in favour of programmatic renewal for the party, given the poor results achieved in recent elections. Executive spokesman Gunda Roestel welcomed the impetus for a new basic platform. Roestel said the Greens must re-establish a stronger connection with German society. She also called on her party to establish a sharper image in economic policy. At a meeting of the youth wing of the party in Leipzig, Roestel said that the competence of the Greens in matters such as business tax reform was not enough in the public consciousness. She added that their partner in the federal coalition, the SPD, was working on modernizing itself through its Schroeder-Blair Paper, and that the Greens had to meet the same challenge. Roestel wants the Green Party to become an active, realistic workshop of modernity.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Railway is considering closing a quarter of its ticket sales counters, or farming them out to travel agencies. The company's spokesman for the Travel and Tourism Department, Martin Katz, said that 250 counters in train stations were no longer economically viable. Plans are to promote ticket sales via the internet or the telephone. Travellers would then be able to print out the previously ordered tickets at vending machines in railway stations.  </field>

<field name="text">Around 2000 animal-rights activists have met in Eschlkam, in the Oberpfalz (Upper Palatinate) region, to protest against the construction of an egg-laying battery plant on the other side of the Czech border. The protest was instigated by cooperating animal rights groups in both countries. In an opening speech at the protest, the leader of the Bavarian SPD, Renate Schmidt, said that such large-scale cruelty to animals could harm the Czech Republic's chances of being accepted into the European Union. The spokesman for the German Animal Protection League, Thomas Schroeder, voiced the suspicion that the plant was being financed by Anton Pohlmann, a businessman from Oldenburg convicted of cruelty to animals. Czech activists demonstrated around the clock at the construction site, where work on a rearing station for 200,000 chicks was begun last Thursday.  </field>

<field name="text">EU budget commissioner designate Ms. Schreyer is considering EU taxes. The Buendnis90/Gruene politician said in an interview with the Hamburg magazine "Stern" that this option should be discussed. The EU should become more independent in deciding about its revenue. Those who decide about expenditures should also be responsible to the citizens for the revenue. Schreyer added that this was not about a higher financial burden but a different financing scheme.

<field name="text">Bavarian State Premier Edmund Stoiber rejects any personal responsibility in the LWS affaire for the losses of millions of marks. The suggestion that he was always informed about each real estate transaction and, thus, that he was responsible, was off the track, said Stoiber. At a press conference he announced the resignation of the current LWS upervisory board. The CSU chief also strongly incriminated the discharged Minister of Justice, Mr. Sauter. In the presence of Sauter, Stoiber said a supervisory board president who excuses himself with that even he was not informed and who despite the incomplete information had trusted the executive board was ignorant of his tasks and duties. The fired justice minister had participated in today's cabinet meeting against Stoiber's will to justify himself again.

<field name="text">The situation of the job market is nearly unchanged. The Federal Labour Office reports that the number of unemployed decreased by 3400 in July to just under 4.024 million in August. The unemployment rate stayed at 103 percent. There were 72'000 fewer unemployed than in August of last year. In Baden-Wuerttemberg the number of unemployed increased slightly, contrary to the federal trend. State-wied there were 323'000 people without a job or just under 7000 more than in July. The unemployment rate was 6.4 percent. In view of the unchanging high rate of unemployment the German federation of unions (DGB) called on the government to put economic development first. The DGB thinks that the released numbers show that the weak economic growth prevented an improvement of the job market. Deputy president of CDU/CSU faction of the Bundestag Dr. Herman Kues accused Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of failure in fighting unemployment.Deputy FDP-president Rainer Bruederle called the situation a disaster of red-green policy.  </field>

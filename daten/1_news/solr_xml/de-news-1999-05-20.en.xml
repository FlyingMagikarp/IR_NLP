<field name="text">Germany's federal bank Bundesbank still takes a recessional view of the country's economy. In their latest monthly report, the chief aim of criticism is excessive increases in wage scale agreements. Furthermore, the unresolved questions in tax and economic policies might have a stifling effect on economic growth. The chairman of the "5 wise men" of the economy called for a significant tax reduction with a top rate of 40% for all income categories. He also suggested that a close look be taken at social services. He suggests that state subsidies such as "child money" should be graded according to necessity, in other words, according to income. In his opinion the economy has been badly shaken by federal government action over the last few months.  </field>

Premier Stoiber stressed that this had not been an expression of Bavarian separatism. He praised the Basic Law as a constitution that continued to be up to date.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Health Minister Andrea Fischer and representatives from the insurance doctors association tried this evening to defuse the battle over the prescription drug budget. Fischer (Greens) called the meeting in Bonn on short notice in reaction to the threat by the physicians to counter the cuts in the drug and medication budget with an emergency plan. According to this plan, doctors would establish a waiting list for non-urgent medication if budget shortfalls are expected. Thyroid medication as well as treatments for fungal infections and diarrhea were named as examples. Health Minister Fischer declared that she would issue a directive banning this emergency plan if necessary. She said a waiting list for patients was unacceptable.  </field>

<field name="text">Several prominent Greens politicians have called for a new environment policy and for closer cooperation with businesses. The "Realists," including the spokesperson for the executive committee Gunda Roestel, presented a 10-point agenda which called for reinstating the environment as the focal point of political action. This was not to be taken as criticism of Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, rather as an appeal to the entire party for a reorientation. In the future, the Greens want to have ecology seen as a part of modernization. A spokesperson for the Federation [of German Industry] said that it was a welcome insight that environmental protection must be carried out in a manner that was also to some extent compatible with business.  </field>

<field name="text">The military is not getting a break during the parliamentary summer break. In a radio interview, SPD military expert Helmut Wieczorek renewed his call to rethink the constitutional limitations on deployment of the armed forces to purely military missions. It was not against the constitution for the armed forces occasionally to assist in police operations, for example in securing the border or combating smuggling rings. The debate was triggered by an article in the "Bild" newspaper. The article referred to a classified speech manuscript by Inspector General Hans-Peter von Kirchbach, according to which the armed forces should prepare itself for new areas of engagement in view of the decreasing threats of danger from the outside. Kirchbach himself vehemently denied that the armed forces would be deployed for domestic security in the future.  </field>

<field name="text">After a camera man's death of yellow fever, Berlin Charite wants to have 400,000 DM reimbursed by the Berlin Senate.

<field name="text">Bavaria is the safest state according to the crime statistics published today by the Free State of Bavaria. Only five crimes are committed per 100 inhabitants - the national average is eight. In the first six months of the year, the number of crimes fell by 1.2 percent to 325,000. State Interior Secretary Regensburger said he was satisfied, "People always ask what the reason could be that things are better in Bavaria than in other states. I believe that we are on the right path when we do not tolerate lawlessness. Secondly, I think it is also an exceptional quality that we have that the relationship between the citizens and the police is for the most part a very good one." Thefts, at 37 percent, made up the largest portion of all crimes.  </field>

<field name="text">The July salary statement brought tears to the eyes of a cleaning lady at the Bavarian state assembly: from her holiday bonus of 325 DM, only 3.48 DM was left after deductions. The Revenue Office kept 99 percent for taxes and social security contributions. The holiday money bumped the woman into a higher tax bracket, thus not much was left.  </field>

<field name="text">Looking at the solar eclipse had consequences for a few fans of the natural phenomenon. At least two people suffered eye injuries. It was particularly bad for an 18-year-old Berlin man who lost 90 percent of his sight. A 15-year-old boy in Schwerin is threatened with permanent retina damage because he looked directly at the sun. There was no mass rush on hospitals, as was feared.  </field>

<field name="text">The majority of SPD state delegates in the Bundesrat put a halt to several laws which had already been approved by the Bundestag. Among the laws affected was the annual tax law for 1997 which was passed yesterday. The sticking point was the governing coalition's planned abolition of the wealth tax. The states now want to begin negotiations with the federal government as quickly as possible, so as to be able to appeal to a mediation committee. The SPD-led states insist that the wealth tax remain in force; they introduced a new bill in the Bundesrat to structure the tax in accordance with constitutional guidelines. Hamburg's Mayor Voscherau made an offer to negotiate. He said in his speech that the federal states stood to lose 9 billion marks a year in tax income. In the coming week, the Bundesrat will hold a special sitting to address the matter again. The SPD-led states will then use their majority to call for a mediation committee to settle the dispute.  The Bundesrat also stopped a law intended to cut the pay of officials on sick-leave - for the third time. The Bundestag can now appeal to the mediation committee one last time. In case the appeal ultimately fails, the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Bonn is already working on a compensation deal. This deal would see the 300,000 federal officials either working longer or having shorter vacations in the future. Finally, the Bundesrat also rejected a natural protection law promoted by federal Environment Minister Merkel. According to Lower Saxony's Environment Minister Griefahn, the law was actually so unfavourable to the protection of nature that it could only be rejected in its entirety.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bundestag today passed a reform of the law dealing with files of the former East German secret police. The CDU/CSU, SPD, and FDP all voted for the change. In the future, the Gauck office, in performing background checks on individuals, will only be permitted to give information on activities performed for the State Security Service after 1 January 1976. Furthermore, so-called minor activities for the Stasi will be swept under the rug. Exceptions from these reforms will be made in the cases of security checks and applications for particularly important positions. The Bundestag also, despite contrary votes form the opposition parties, passed new regulations concerning the settlement of wealth and ownership questions in East German agriculture. Thus, members of former collective agricultural operations will have broadened chances to pursue their claims against the enterprises that succeeded them.  </field>

<field name="text">Yesterday's wage negotiations in Baden-Wuerttemberg are stalemated, and each sides' positions are more entrenched. The IG Metall reiterated their willingness to strike in defense of full salary payment during sick leave. Arbitration is to decide the matter in Baden-Wuerttemberg. If the arbitration is resolved by upholding the validity of the wage contract, the full sick time payment in Baden-Wuerttemberg would continue until the end of 1998, the length of the existing blanket agreement. The situation in Bavaria appears to be different, because the blanket agreement there has already expired. Therefore the sick pay issue could be the cause of a strike as early as next February. Significant discord could also erupt in other parts of the Republic in industry. Vice chairman of the IG Metall Walter Riester announced yesterday that if industry permits the talks to fail, no factory council should plan on using overtime. Riester sees this as a sort of preparatory action to a strike in Bavaria. There is still a possibility, however slight, of avoiding a further escalation of the battle over sick pay. On November 19, negotiations are planned in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the failure of the talks in Karlsruhe these talks are given little chance of success.  </field>

<field name="text">One week after the flight of the last international aid worker, the plight of the refugees in eastern Zaire worsened dramatically.  All aid has been cut off from hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom are already suffering from hunger or dehydration. Heedless of the dramatic situation the European community restricted itself today to further discussion and calls for help. Foreign Minister Kinkel ruled out the participation of German troops in the case of peace troops being sent to Zaire. The Federal government is as skeptically opposed as ever to military intervention in the central African crisis region. In any case the question of the use of Bundeswehr troops is not being raised. According to Kinkel, all available possibilities must be exhausted, be they bilateral, European, or in conjunction with the use of the United Nations. But his answer to the specific question of the use of German soldiers in such a multinational force in the region was that he could see no such participation.  </field>

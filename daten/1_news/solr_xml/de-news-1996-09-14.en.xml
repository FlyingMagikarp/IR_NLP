<field name="text">A few days before the conference of federal and state ministers of the interior, there still seems to be no clear consensus concerning the return of Bosnian refugees.   Speaking to the news Magazine DER SPIEGEL, the minister of the interior of Schleswig-Holstein expressed his disagreement with beginning the forced return as early as October first.  Making these people leave before the beginning of winter would be unreasonable, since 60 % of dwellings and homes had been destroyed, he stated.  everything pointed in the direction of not setting a deadline, the SPD politician said.  On the other hand, after returning from a reconnaissance trip, his colleagues from Lower Saxony, Hamburg and Bavaria declared that they wanted to stay with the first of October.  That is also the position of Federal Minister of the Interior Kanther.  </field>

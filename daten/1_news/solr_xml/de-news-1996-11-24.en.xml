<field name="text">The federal government has denied reports that Chancellor Kohl hopes to pass noticeable reductions in tax rates as early as 1998. In an interview in Bonn, speaker of the government Hausmann denied the correctness of an article published by the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag," in which the paper had claimed that in view of the upcoming federal elections, the Chancellor had considered introducing tax cuts. However, during unofficial talks, there had been mention of a reduction in solidarity as well as in income tax. Until now, Kohl had maintained that there would be no tax cuts until 1999.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal President Herzog has completed his state visit to China and overall gave the trip positive marks. Concerning the political negotiations in which he participated during his stay, Herzog commented that this had been his most difficult foreign visit to date. However, it had become evident that despite differences in opinion an open dialogue was going to be possible. When asked why he had been able to address the subject of human rights more openly than Foreign Minister Kinkel, Herzog noted that he usually attempted to convey unpleasant truths diplomatically. He did not want to give any, possibly premature, evaluation of his specific accomplishments during this visit. He did note, however, that there was no question that he would continue the dialogue with a future super power like China. When asked how much longer he thought China would be able to play individual Western countries off against each other, Herzog answered that the Western countries were still lacking a coordinated political approach toward China. In a mild rebuke of his government, he added that at least Bonn had not been able to give him any specific information on the subject.  </field>

<field name="text">Iranian police have prevented a demonstration by Islamic extremists in front of the German embassy in Teheran this morning. Several hundred armed police officers held back the demonstrators. One police leader told the crowd that after the appeasing speech of Iranian President Rafsandchani (sp?), there was no more need for anti-German protests. On Friday, Rafsandchani (sp?) had defended Germany despite massive protests in his country regarding the Mykonos trial.  Foreign Minister Kinkel has reaffirmed his former statement that he was going to continue his current policy toward Iran. In an interview with the TV station "ZDF" today, he said that despite obvious problems the dialogue was to be continued. Last week, the cabinet also showed its support of this course of action.  The Iranian parliament rejected a proposal by some two hundred representatives calling for a re-evaluation of the political ties to Germany in light of the Mykonos trial.  </field>

<field name="text">Bonn politicians and the German taxpayers' association have called to limit the time spent on side jobs by judges and civil servants. They voiced their request in the wake of the recent scandal around the president of the Hesse State Court, Heinrichs, who has now resigned. In an interview with the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung," the speaker for judicial politics of the CDU parliamentary section, Geis, called all judges to be cautious about taking on side jobs. His counterpart for the SPD, Martenbach, suggested to tie each license to take such work to the honorarium for the job in question. The president of the taxpayers' association, Daeke, noted that such extraordinary jobs were not well regulated and were too easily licensed. He proposed that in the future such side jobs should be closely monitored.  </field>

<field name="text">Leader of the CSU and Federal Finance Minister, Theo Waigel has renewed his calls for an end to the internal debate about parliamentary group leader Schaeuble. The question of whether Schaeuble will definitely one day become Kohl's successor is irrelevant at the present time, Waigel said in Washington. He added that the CDU and CSU were entering into the Bundestag election campaign with Kohl at the helm, and that they all had to do their best to ensure that he was re-elected as Chancellor. CDU Secretary-General Hintze emphasized that the CDU and CSU would continue to choose joint leadership candidates into the future. He also called on the sister parties to close ranks and enter into the election campaign working together. Bavarian Premier Stoiber expressed similar sentiments, saying that differences of opinion on factual questions must not be allowed to lead to attacks on Schaeuble's integrity. Despite all such calls for solidarity within the Union parties, some members of the CSU continue to criticize Schaeuble's tack vis-a-vis the Opposition.  </field>

<field name="text">Ten Red Cross workers have been abducted in Somalia, including a German agricultural expert. According to information which the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva received out of Nairobi, Kenya, none of the workers have been injured. However, the reasons for the abduction are still completely unclear. According to a Red Cross spokesman, there have, as yet, been no demands made by the kidnappers. The word from Geneva is that efforts are being made to procure the release of the abducted workers, and that there was reason to be confident of success, because the Red Cross had good ties to the clans fighting for power in Somalia. It is still unknown who is behind the abduction. The Red Cross has so far declined to confirm suspicions that the kidnappers were followers of Ali Machtin (sp?), one of the most powerful clan leaders in the country.  </field>

<field name="text">There has apparently been some movement in the critical third round of wage negotiations in the construction industry for Western Germany. The Secretary-General of the Central Association of the German Construction Industry, Schroer, said this evening in Mainz that negotiations were proceeding apace. He indicated that employers and unions were working on a package deal which both sides would hopefully be able to agree to. Schroer did not mention any details. This round of talks began with demonstrations for higher wages; there has been no such offer from the employers. The Construction, Agriculture, and Environment union ("Bauen, Agrar und Umwelt")is insisting on an increase in real income, and is calling for 4 percent higher wages. The employers, on the other hand, only want to discuss a wage increase if it is compensated for by cuts in other areas; they suggest cutting 3 vacation days a year. The union categorically rejects that idea, Chairman Klaus Wiesenhuegel of the construction union IG-Bau calling it sleight-of-hand to take money out of the one pocket of the workers and put it back in the other.  </field>

<field name="text">The substitute public health insurance company, Barmer, wants the number of doctors in Germany to be limited by law. The federal government announced as early as 1992 that it would pass such a law, but so far no bill to that effect has been introduced in the Bundestag. Barmer's chairman, Fiedler, said Germany already had too many doctors, and every additional doctor gave rise to new costs; he added that in the middle term, the number of practicing doctors in the country should even be lowered. This strategy is the insurance company's response to the attempt by doctors, faced with falling incomes, to bill patients directly, and at higher than the state-approved rates, for more and more of their services. Barmer is also demanding of the politicians that they allow doctors in private practice to use expensive equipment in hospitals, for the reason that the outfitting of private practices with high-tech equipment resulted more and more often in unnecessary examinations and even treatments (to justify the purchase price of the equipment).  </field></doc></add>

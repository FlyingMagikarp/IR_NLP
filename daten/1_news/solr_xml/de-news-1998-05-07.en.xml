<field name="text">Minister for interior Kanther and minister for justice Schmidt-Jorzig have put an end to their fight about setting up gene files. They came to a consensus that the so-called "genetic fingerprint" could be lifted and filed from all legally condemned persons. There is not to be a special law, but just an amendment to criminal process procedures. The gene file, to be administrated by the Wiesbaden Federal Criminal Office, is meant to increase the speed of discovering and arresting repeaters. To identify a culprit, remains of blood, skin, saliva or sperm can be used; often just a single hair is sufficient.  </field>

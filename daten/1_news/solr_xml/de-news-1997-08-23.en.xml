<field name="text">The Federal Ministry of Health has called for the EU- commission to implement the strict observance of the export ban of beef in Great Britain.  A spokeswoman of the Health Ministry stated criticism of the fact that the export ban, which had been established in 1996 because of the BSE-scandal, has only been implemented since August 1, 1997 in Great Britain.  The chairperson of the BSE investigation committee of the European Parliament, Mr. Boege, blamed slipshod controls for the fact that more than 600 tons of British beef illegally arrived in  Germany.  Mr. Boege called on grocery chains and manufacturers to reconsider their purchasing policies. In the meantime, the British newspaper DAILY TELEGRAPH published a report issued by British veterinarians according to which the statistics of the EU-countries do not reflect the true extent of mad cow disease BSE.  The report claims that the number of fatal BSE outbreaks in cattle exported from Great Britain is actually six times as high as officially reported.  </field>

<field name="text"> According to Federal Minister for Finance Waigel, he is counting on a cabinet reorganization - which he has called forbefore the parliamentary elections of 1998.  This is reported by the magazine FOCUS.  Mr. Waigel reportedly stated that he was sure that Federal Chancellor Kohl would not disappoint him in this expectation.  On the other hand, CDU-Secretary General Hintze once again stated that there was no chance of such a reorganization. Mr. Hintze told the Sunday edition of the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that Mr. Kohl did not have any intention of reorganizing the cabinet.

<field name="text">The German Institute for Economic Research expects an additional shortfall in tax revenue during the current year amounting to 10 to 15 billion.  The report states that a shortfall of at least 15 billion should be included in calculations.  The reason the Institute finds for this is that economic growth in the West at 2 per cent and in the East at 1.5 per cent is lower than the government predicted.  In case the federal government and the states can not agree on  clear net tax relief measures, the economic researchers recommend the total abolition of the solidarity surtax.  This cut would result in  approximately 30 billion in tax relief.  </field>

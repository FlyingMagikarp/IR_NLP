Talks about a compact for work, however, were not generally off, according to Mr Schulte.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Rexrodt, Federal Minister of Economics, thinks that the German economy has got back into gear again, quoting about .75% growth for this year. Next year, however, this could rise to 2 or 2.5%. Labour markets would stay depressed, though. This year he was expecting some 320,000 more persons to become unemployed. Referring to the dispute between the EU and VW about subsidies, he said that his government would try and go for a compromise that would also take into account the European Union's concerns.  </field>

<field name="text">Lower Saxony's and Bavaria's ministers for internal affairs have travelled to Bosnia to find out about the situation at the pit-face and what returning refugees would be facing there. And they also want to determine, if some 320,000 refugees currently in Germany would be able to return from 1 October, as planned. North-Rhine/Westphalia's minister, however, pointed out that  some conditions for the refugees' return had not been met yet, for example the cancellation of local elections in Bosnia proving that there was not enough stability there. Bavaria's minister said, after he had arrived at Sarajevo, that this visit would not be the sole base for assessing re-patriation.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Tietmayer, of the Bundesbank, thinks the discussion about raising sales tax (VAT) is not right. He thinks reforming tax is okay, but the emphasis of the discussion should not be on more tax. The general idea is less tax, and that is why there should not be any discussion about raising sales tax at this stage.  </field>

<field name="text">The financial situation of the public health insurers has deteriorated even further. Mr Kaula, of the insurers' association, told the HANNOVERSCHEN ALLGEMEINEN ZEITUNG, that things were so bad that he would not rule out that some insurers would be unable to meet their commitments. The half-private Ersatzkassen, however, were not prepared to take out loans for operating costs. Once any surplus was used up, people would have to think about models where suppliers of health-care would not get more than partial payments.  </field>

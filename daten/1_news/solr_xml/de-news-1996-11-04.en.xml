<field name="text">According to Berlin mayor Diepgen, Turkey should be guided by the principles of democracy, tolerance, and human rights on its way to become a member of the European Union. Diepgen spoke on the occasion of the visit of Turkish president Suleyman Demirel to Berlin. While Diepgen praised the traditionally good relations between Berlin and Turkey, protesters outside City Hall criticized the Turkish actions in Kurdistan. Several protesters were arrested following clashes with the police. Demirel began his four-day visit to Germany meeting with representatives of various Turkish organizations. Afterwards, he was received with military honors by German president Roman Herzog at Bellevue castle. A walk through the Brandenburg Gate was followed by a formal dinner. Herzog called on Turkey to observe human rights, saying that more than anything, Turkish compliance with human rights principles would improve chances to further integrate Turkey within Europe. He expressed hopes that Turkey would find constructive ways to solve the Kurdish conflict. Herzog emphasized that, despite a number of terrible events over the past few years, Germany is a country that welcomes foreigners. Demirel called for further measures to integrate Turkish citizens living in Germany, saying that they have the same responsibilities but not the same rights as Germans.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called upon Indonesia to respect the Human Rights. During a public event in Indonesia's capital Jakarta Kohl said political leaders are also judged by their ability to create social justice while applying democratic principles. He advocated to discuss openly differences in opinion about Human Rights. Respecting the universally acknowledged Basic and Human Rights is of central importance, Kohl said. One has to keep in view the welfare of humankind and discuss openly among friends about differences in interpretation. In view of different cultures, however, one has to respect each other and be ready to learn from each other.  Kohl stressed he had also addressed the Human Rights issue when he talked to President Suharto. The President, however, did not mention the issue at all at a dinner that evening. Instead, he thanked for the delivery of 39 war ships from the GDR navy as they are very useful for the defence of his country's territorial integrity.  Early this morning, sources within the German delegation initially confirmed that Kohl would meet Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Belo from East-Timor, but later the meeting had been cancelled. In the evening, Kohl expressed his regrets that the planned meeting with Bishop Belo did not take place.  Chancellor Kohl stressed later in Jakarta that he had tried hard to arrange a meeting with the bishop. His plan had been supported by the papal Nuncio, the bishop's order, and the Cardinal of Jakarta. Belo had also been offered a plane for the trip to the capital. The Bishop had declined Kohl's invitation because he was on a confirmation trip within his diocese.  This morning 25 economic agreements have been signed in Jakarta. The contracts between government agencies and companies are worth about DM1 billion. The contracts regard amongst others the ship , transportation, steel, and natural gas industry. Earlier, Kohl and President Suharto had discussed the economic relations between both countries.  </field>

<field name="text">Liberal Member of Parliament Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger expects that the argument within the government coalition about the tax reform will gain acuteness. So far there is no ready concept for the financing of planned lower income tax rates, the former Federal Minister of Justice said in a radio interview. After recent arguments within the coalition she was not very optimistic about the upcoming deliberations about this part of the tax reform. At the same time she criticized the tax discussion in her own party. One could not demand the lowering of tax rates without presenting a complete financing plan at the same time. Currently the FDP executive deliberates budget and appropriation issues in Bonn.  </field>

<field name="text">Rita Suessmuth, Bundestag House Speaker, supports the introduction of a pension insurance for part-time workers and the unemployed. In an interview with the BILD-Zeitung, the chairwoman of the Christian Women's Union said that in times of great changes in the working environment it was imperative to keep workers from falling through cracks in the compulsory pension system. Suessmuth suggested a possible solution of splitting up the 20 percent tax on minor jobs (those paying no more than 590 marks a month) into a 10 percent tax and a 10 percent contribution to the federal pension fund.  </field>

<field name="text">Erwin Huber, Bavarian Minister of Finance, demands the cancellation of wage contracts for public service employees to facilitate cuts in sick pay. Writing to Federal Minister of the Interior Manfred Kanther and to the wage commission of the federal states, Huber expressed his opinion that the principle of equality would require this move. In addition, it would show solidarity with employers in private businesses. Huber expects difficult negotiations in the public service sector but said that a solution had to be found that would be fair in the current situation.  </field>

<field name="text">Following a move by the SPD, the Bundestag will have a special meeting on Wednesday in order to discuss the budget. The SPD demanded a government declaration on "disturbance of the economic balance." According to the SPD, only a parliamentary statement on the disturbance of the balance could prevent the 1996 budget from being unconstitutional. In an interview with Radio Fritz, Alfred Gaertler stated that the SPD is now fulfilling its task, forcing the government to declare insolvency. He said that the ritual is foreseeable: the chancellor would decline involvement and continue his travels in Asia. The governing coalition would reject the statement that the economic situation is off-balance and thus new debts will have to exceed investments this year. Instead, FDP and CDU/CSU would criticize the SPD for calling the special meeting.  </field>

The two Ministers also called for changes of proposals by the European Commission concerning limits for exhaust fumes and improvements to the quality of petrol.  </field>

<field name="text">At the Regional Court of the State of Hesse the so-called Wood varnish proceedings have been reopened today. Two managers of Duesseldorf-based chemical company Desowag (sp?) are charged for not having stopped production and sale of a wood protection agent although they allegedly knew about the high toxicity of some of the ingredients. The proceedings had to be reopened after the Federal High Court quashed the ruling at first instance. Three years ago, the two managers were sentenced to two years imprisonment on probation and a fine of DM120,000. In the original trial several dozen affected persons who had become seriously ill were suing the company.  </field>

<field name="text">The States of Brandenburg and Berlin want to set course today for their future fine-tuned co-operation. On the agenda of the two states' joint planning conference are resolutions on the development programme of the region. Since last year a treaty between the two States rules the planning of the states.

Government officials and several cabinet members from Berlin and Potsdam took part in the conference.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government and the state government of Saxony want to save the machine manufacturer Heckert. BVS -the successor to the Treuhand trust agency which was established after German reunification to oversee the privatization of former East German state enterprises- and Saxony have indicated, however, that they will only help the company if the Deutsche Bank is also involved. The bank has refused Heckert further credit after the manufacturer's West German parent company, Traub, registered receivership.  In Chemnitz today, staff demonstrated against the threatening bankruptcy of the company. The workers' committee and the union IG Metall called for the Heckert plant to be treated separately from the parent company.  </field>

<field name="text">The public prosecutor in Luebeck is proceeding against the management of the nuclear power plant Kruemmel because of suspected faulty installations. The move is in reaction to charges brought against the plant after a news report on defects in the reactor building. Over the weekend, NDR radio reported that management had fulfilled safety requirements only late or not at all. The power plant is suspected of being the cause of the much higher than usual occurrence of leukaemia in the Elbmarsch area. The plant is presently not in operation.  </field>

<field name="text">Two Frenchmen were beaten yesterday in Eisenhuettenstadt, in the federal state of Brandenburg, continuing a series of attacks on foreigners in that state. Last Thursday two British students were assaulted and injured by unknown assailants in Oranienburg. While the perpetrators in that case are still unknown, a 21-year-old man was identified in the Eisenhuettenstadt case. He has been arrested.  Brandenburg's Minister of Internal Affairs, Ziel, has announced that the state will undertake preventative measures against violent crime. The police have apparently been ordered to draw up files on potentially violent youths in each police district. The SPD minister warned, however, that a solution to the problem of violence could not be expected from the police alone; society as a whole would have to address the causes of such brutality.  </field>

They are protesting against the federal government's education policies, as well as the newest cuts imposed by the state legislature, which they say further restrict equality of access. They referred especially to plans to introduce tuition payments of DM1,500 [rather than just the nominal administrative fee which students have paid until now].  </field></doc></add>

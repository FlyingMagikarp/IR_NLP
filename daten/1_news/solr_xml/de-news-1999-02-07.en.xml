<field name="text">Russia is sticking to it's opposition to NATO extending membership to Eastern European countries, in particularly countries from the former Soviet Union. Russia's acting Minister of Foreign Affairs said at the conference on Security Politics in Munich that Russia's position regarding NATO applications from Poland and the Czech Republic was still negative. He said that although his country did not have the right to veto, they still could express their opinion on the matter. He continued that cooperation between NATO and Russia would be better if the problem of expansion to the Eastern European countries did not exist.  </field>

<field name="text">In the eastern German state of Hesse, 4.3 million voters were called to the polls to vote for state parliament. The election was won by the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Free Democrats (FDP) after eight years of a red-green government in the state. Until election day itself, pollsters had predicted that the SPD and Green party would have a slight lead. The election campaign had mainly concentrated on the dispute regarding changes to citizenship laws in Germany.  The next premier minister of the state of Hesse will most likely be from the CDU. According to the last projections on the ARD TV station, the CDU's top candidate, Roland Koch, had achieved 43.3 percent of the vote, an increase of around four percentage points. His election to power will depend on their proposed coalition partner's (FDP) election results. At the moment it seems that the FDP have managed to overcome the five percent hurdle by achieving 5.2 percent of the vote. In the last election, however, the FDP had managed to achieve a result at least two percentage points higher. According to current results, the current red-green state government under the leadership of Hans Eichel have lost the election. The SPD only attained 39.3 percent of the vote, and although this was an increase of two percentage points the Greens had only got 7.3 percent. If these results are confirmed, the red-green coalition in Hesse will have lost the election and Hans Eichler will no longer be the parliamentary leader of his party in state parliament.  </field>

<field name="text">After the disappointing election results in Hesse, the Social Democrats are now looking at possible consequences at the federal level. Mr. Schreiner, Federal Secretary General of the SPD, has hinted that the reason for losing voters was due to the sort of PR of some politicians in the Green Party and that this must stop. "We probably have to think about emphasising social democratic areas of interest, such as fighting unemployment, social justice and so on."  Angela Merkel, The General Secretary of the CDU, had said before the election that if the CDU did well in the state elections in Hesse, this would be a comment on the Juergen Trittin's (Greens) policies regarding reducing atomic energy. Moreover, the government's plans regarding citizenship laws had mobilised voters.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder warned the Greens not to make any far-reaching demands on the SPD in the wake of their compromise decision on the war in Kosovo. The result would not be a new willingness to move forward on Green pet projects. Schroeder told "Focus" magazine that the Green party conference motion represented a turning point for the Greens and progress for Germany. However, the Greens would not earn any bonus points for having finally made it.  </field>

<field name="text">The head of the federal Green Party, Gunda Roestel, has rejected speculation that Juergen Trittin, the Minister of the Environment, would be moving to Brussels.  Instead she suggested Michaele Schreyer, the leader of the parliamentary group in Berlin, might be proposed as an EU commissioner. "The central committee will decide on Monday that we need a woman," said Roestel.  She said that Trittin will definitely not be proposed as an EU commissioner.  </field>

<field name="text">This afternoon, the state SPD party conference confirmed the 55 year old Renate Schmidt in office by a large majority -- and for the last time, since she will step down some time in the next two years. Although Renate Schmidt has been responsible for massive organizational and structural changes over the last 8 years, and has criticized the party, it did not begrudge her its support. Re-elected with 90% of the vote, Schmidt called on the party to make another push, to get over its roll as bearer of the true faith and to reform itself from the inside out. Ms. Schmidt will step down in 2001, but will remain the acting federal party chief until then. As such, she has defended the leading proposal of the state party regarding the government's Kosovo policy.  Eliciting enormous criticism from Chancellor Schroeder, this proposal calls for an immediate, temporary and supervised cease fire by NATO in the Balkans.  Approximately 100 Young Socialists and other left-wing members of the party put forth proposals that go farther in demanding an end to the intervention of NATO and the German Army in Kosovo. Many of them wore buttons that said "NATO Out of Kosovo."  But Renate Schmidt warned against descending into internecine warfare and said the Bavarian SPD had to guard against the impression that they were stabbing the government in the back over its Kosovo policy. "The Chancellor and the Defense Minister have worked themselves to the edge of exhaustion and are always struggling hard to come to the right decision.  I will come down hard and decisively on anyone that dares to call Gerhard Schroeder or Rudolf Scharping war-mongers or anything of that sort.  It's not right and it won't be stood for."  At bottom, Schmidt said there had to be more party discipline and more loyalty shown the government. She warned that those who refused to follow and show solidarity with their representatives in Bonn would in the long run render them incapable of action.  </field>

<field name="text">The members of the Bavarian Teachers Association (the BLLV) want to put to a vote whether they should initiate a referendum against extending the non-college preparatory high school program to 6 grades.  The BLLV is in favor of four year of elementary schooling followed by two more years of differentiated studies. The state government of Bavaria, on the other hand, now plans for students to make the transition into secondary school after the fourth grade.  </field>

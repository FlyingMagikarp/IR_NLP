<field name="text">The national poverty conference has complained of the growing social exclusion in Germany. Speakers at the meeting stated that a growing number of households are living just above the poverty line. Meanwhile, for the first time since reunification, the proportion of wealthy households has risen, from four to five percent. It is mainly long-term unemployment which causes the fall into poverty and social exclusion. The speakers demanded a significant expansion of social-security payable, union wage agreed employment as the only way to take those affected out of the social security trap.

<field name="text">The Social Democrats have claimed Kohl is responsible for the misery in the east German labour market. SPD fraction leader Scharping and a Saxony MP Schwanitz said in Bonn that by setting the wrong political course, the federal government has brought the recovery of the new Laender to its knees. A long-term continuation of labour market measures in east Germany is unavoidable, in order to prevent a further increase in unemployment there. If they win at the federal elections the SPD will make more money available for employment promotion.  </field>

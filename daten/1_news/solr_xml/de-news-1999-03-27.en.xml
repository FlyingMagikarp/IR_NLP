<field name="text">NATO expanded their air strikes on Yugoslavian targets tonight. NATO Secretary General Solana ordered the beginning of the second phase of the attack. NATO forces will no longer be limited to attacks on the Yugoslavian air force and other military facilities, but they will also be attacking armored tanks and ground forces in Kosovo. Numerous fighter planes took off again from the Northern Italian NATO base in Aviano tonight. In addition, an AVACS plane took off to monitor the radar. The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dini stated that the military action could last all night.  Another series of heavy explosions were reported tonight in Belgrade. Meanwhile, NATO officials assured the public again that they would continue their actions until Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, agrees to sign the Balkan contact group's peace agreement.  </field>

<field name="text">There were many protests against the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia in numerous cities throughout Germany today. In Berlin, several thousand people followed the PDS's call to demonstrate against the attacks. [The PDS is a somewhat controversial political party because it descends from the ruling party of the former East Germany.]  Approximately 3,000 Yugoslavians who are loyal to the government took to the streets in Stuttgart; approximately 1,000 protested in Nuremberg. Protests were reported in many other European countries; the largest protests took place in Italy, where more than 20,000 people protested against the NATO attacks. Students in Milan chanted anti-war slogans like "Yankee go home" and protested in front of the US Consulate.  </field>

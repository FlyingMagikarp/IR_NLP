<field name="text">Award-talks in the metal industry and the public service have not got any closer to reaching an agreement. All over Germany some 150,000 metal workers downed tools today for a short while, following an appeal by their union. These actions are to be extended next week, according to deputy union leader Peters, in case the employers did not come up with a new offer at the beginning of next week. So far they had offered 2% more pay, while the union was asking for 6.5%.  In Stuttgart the first round of award-talks for the public service broke up without any result. The union wants 5.5% more pay, while representatives of federal, state and communal employers have not made an offer so far.  </field>

<field name="text">Following the ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) on the treatment of families, the debate about how to implement the ruling and pay for it, still rages on. Both SPD and Finance Minister were critical about Mr Schroeder's proposal to scrap family benefits for high earners. The Finance Minister, however, ruled out retroactive measures for families with children before the year 2000. The chance of complaints against tax assessments based on the recent court ruling therefore would be nil.  </field>

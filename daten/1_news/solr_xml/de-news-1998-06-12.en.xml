<field name="text">Because of the current Kosovo crisis, NATO intends to begin air-manoeuvres over Albania and Macedonia as early as this Sunday, according to a decision made by the NATO defence ministers at this spring's meeting in Brussels. This is meant to demonstrate that the armed forces are prepared and ready to act, and also to force Yugoslavian president Milosevic to end violence in the Kosovo region. Four German Tornado fighter planes will take part in the manoeuvres. The liaison group for the Balkan offered Mr Milosevic an ultimatum: Great Britain's Foreign Minister Cook said at one of the group's meetings in London that there would be consequences if Mr Milosevic did not fulfil certain conditions. Some of the conditions are: an armistice, supervised retreat of troops and the return of some 15,000 Kosovo-Albanian refugees to their homes.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Maier, head of the Central Organisation of German Catholics, hopes for common worship with protestants. Currently rules of the Catholic church do not allow for this.  Mr Lehmann, president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops, announced that there would be a new proposal this autumn as far as counselling of pregnant women was concerned. He also stated that a solution was needed that did not imply an entitlement to abortion. So no-one in the working-group knew what to do. Previously Federal President Herzog and Speaker of the Parliament Suessmuth (Bundestagspraesidentin) had asked the catholic church to stick with the state-system of counselling.  </field>

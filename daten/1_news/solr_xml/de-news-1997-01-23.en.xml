<field name="text">The planned reform of the German tax law will lead to the lowest tax rates in the past 50 years, according to Finance Minister T. Waigel.  During an official introduction of the concept before journalists in Bonn, Waigel explained that the model would cause an extensive tax relief for almost all tax payers and additionally simplify the tax system.  This would create the conditions for more investments, economic growth and employment.  Referring to the concerns of CDU experts for social policy about taxing retirement payments, Waigel agreed that this is likely one of the most difficult parts of the reform.  The average retiree would not have to pay higher taxes, though. The parliamentary party leader of the SPD, Mr. Solms, stressed during the press conference that substantial progress has been made towards the goal of designing lower, fairer and easier taxes.  The coalition government declined comment as to whether and by how much the sales tax might be increased. Mr. Waigel said that the results of the commission for the refrom of the pension plans should be awaited first.  Earlier, the parties of CDU/CSU and FDP had internally approved the tax reform.  However, some members of the CDU/CSU and FDP abstained or voted against the proposition.  Supposedly the Minister of Employment, Mr. Bluem, and vice-parliamentary party leader, Mr. Geissler, voted against the concept.  The proposition says that starting 1999, the rates for income tax should be between 15% and 39%, using a combination of progressive and linear taxing rates.  For tax payers and enterprises the total tax cut would add up to 30 billion DM.  In order to finance this concept, special tax deductions are to be be reduced or eliminated.  In the meantime the CDU/CSU and FDP coalition called on the SPD to support the bill in the Bundesrat.  So far the oppositional parties appeared to be resistant.  Criticism targeted mostly the possible hike of the sales taxes.  State Premier of Lower Saxony Schroeder explained to the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper that the reform would cause mainly relief for the higher incomes.  Conversely employer-representatives showed support for the proposition.  </field>

<field name="text">In view of the latest BSE case within the European Union, the Ministers of Agriculture of Germany and of The Netherlands have demanded a standardized labeling system indicating the origin of cattle.  The Ministers said at the Cologne-Bonn airport that a corresponding resolution could be passed in February.  According to Federal Minister Borchert, evidence is accumulating that carcasses of BSE infected animals have been imported directly from Great Britain.  Only a genetic analysis could reveal whether the cattle originated from mother cows sold to The Netherlands.  The Ministry of Agriculture in Bonn wants to request EU funds to recompense farmers whose livestock falls under the mandatory BSE slaughtering program.  A resolution was passed yesterday according to which about 5,200 cattle imported from Great Britain and Switzerland are to be killed.  The offspring are to be put under observation.  </field>

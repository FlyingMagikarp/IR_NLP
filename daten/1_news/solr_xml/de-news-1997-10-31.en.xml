<field name="text">Today the governing coalition parties approved raising sales tax to 16% - to take some of the heat off the public pension scheme by using extra revenue for them. More than likely the draft will not get passed into law, as the opposition SPD already declared they would vote it down in the Upper House (Bundesrat). Federal Labour Minister Bluem accused the SPD of deserting the public pension scheme in order to do their own electioneering. The fact that the contribution rate to the public pension scheme had to go up would underline the requirement for alternative finance (meaning using part of the tax-take to plug holes in the pension scheme).  </field>

<field name="text">Today the association of pension schemes warned against higher contributions and lower pensions - something impossible to ram down ordinary citizens' throats these days. Government apparently agrees, though Federal Labour Minister Bluem had to announce that the contribution rate to the public pension scheme was to rise to a record 21%. And it looks like this is final, in spite of a draft law about raising sales tax (see previous item). Pension expert Andreas Sturm, of the CDU, blamed the consistently high unemployment rate for the loss in revenue and the resulting higher contribution rates. And that is why he thought it hard to believe the SPD intended to vote against government's draft (to raise sales tax) using their majority in the Upper House (Bundesrat). "If you throw a spanner in the works now, you take the blame for long-lasting high contributions to the pension scheme." This was refuted by Mr Dressler, of the SPD. The SPD was against raising sales tax as it would help to finance a reform of the pension scheme they had always been against (as it meant lower pensions). "Mr Bluem wants to re-finance in order to get a tighter grip on people's pensions. The SPD wants to re-finance to avoid cutting pensions." Mr Dressler said government should the raise excise-duty on motor-spirits to pay for the pension scheme (and leave sales-tax as is), and that would not even require the Upper House's (Bundesrat) consent. There is some disagreement within the coalition parties about raising the excise-duty on motor-spirits.  </field>

<field name="text">Head of the FDP Gerhardt showed signs of accepting a compromise in the issue of dual citizenship. He said there was no general debate about dual citizenship for foreign children; they rather should be offered a way to reach integration and a chance to take out German citizenship. So far the FDP was for automatically granting German citizenship to children born in Germany (to non-citizens) once they turn 18. A majority in the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, however, is against.  All parties agree that they disagree, though there are plans to give foreigners a binding undertaking that they will be granted citizenship, once they fulfil certain conditions.  </field>

<field name="text">Government decided to keep prosecuting certain offences in the former GDR until the year 2000 - thereafter prosecution would be waived. This would be for less than severe offences, such as manipulation of justice, causing bodily harm and unlawful detention. The deadline would have expired at the end of this year, practically putting a lid on prosecutions.  </field>

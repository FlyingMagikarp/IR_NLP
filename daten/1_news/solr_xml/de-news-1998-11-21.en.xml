<field name="text">The red/green tax proposals continue to be criticized by members of one of the coalition's own parties.  Mr. Clement, the Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, called on the government to make a drastic change of course, to the applause of the opposition.  The General Secretary of the FDP, Mr. Westerwelle, called Clement's letter incendiary.  Only yesterday, Chancellor Schroeder said that the red/green coalition had wanted to do too much, too fast and he admitted mistakes had been made.  Several of these mistakes were harped on by Mr. Clement.  According to "Focus," he put down several of his criticisms in writing and sent them to the Chancellor and the Finance Minister.  In the nine-page letter, Clement is said to have called upon his party colleagues to make a radical change in direction. According to "Focus," he said that the current proposals would be a 30 billion mark burden on the economy at the very least, and this was no way to create more jobs.  In the same article, Clement called on the government to lower the top tax bracket to less than 40%, the bottom tax bracket to 15%, and the corporate tax to less than 30%.  Yesterday Clement heaped on more criticism, this time of the new regulations proposed for low-paying or "620 mark" jobs.  In common with the Minister President of Bavaria, Mr. Stoiber, Clement declared that the federal government would have to answer for the tax shortfalls these regulations would cause the states.  </field>

<field name="text">Criticism of Clement's criticism came today from Erlangen, site of the state party conference of the Bavarian Greens.  With reference to Clement, party spokeswoman Gunda Roestel warned against unraveling the Bonn coalition agreements.  She said that red/policies had to be implemented as agreed upon, point by point.  Gunda Roestel also expressed criticism of recent statements by the the Federal Interior Minister, Mr. Schily, who has rejected the idea of increased immigration into Germany.  People recognized that such sentiments are often voiced by SPD rank and file in the local pubs, said the Green spokeswoman, but they must not be inflamed by the party's office holders.  In her speech, Gunda Roestel also mentioned structural reforms in her own party.  She said that serious thought had to be given at both the federal and state level to the recent deviation from a fundamental Green principle, to wit, that officeholders should be recallable in the middle of their term if they cease to represent the will of the members.  </field>

<field name="text">German Rail has confirmed that a planned investment in new trains will be postponed.  At the same time it rejected a report by the news magazine "Der Spiegel" that the railroads would be making drastic cutbacks in passenger service.  In its Monday edition, "Der Spiegel" wrote that 2.3 billion marks in cutbacks are scheduled to be made in short-haul service between now and the year 2003.  The magazine said that orders for 600 new locomotives, rail cars, S-Bahn cars and new experimental "leaning trains" have been cancelled.  The reason for all these cutbacks, according to Der Spiegel, is a downward trend in this year's number of short-haul passengers.  In contrast, German Rail maintains that the planned investments are being pushed back by technical difficulties with the new trains.  According to German Rail, none of the new generation of trains that have been supplied so far have been without serious problems once they got out the drawing room and onto the tracks.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Federation of Unions as well as many individual unions have called on their fellow citizens to stand up for public broadcasting.  A conference on the media closed with a joint statement.  It said that in the absence of public broadcasting, both the variety of information and the freedom of public opinion -- two pillars of a functioning democracy -- would be endangered.  Broadcasting could not be reduced to a purely commercial enterprise, the statement continued.  The union appeal found support among the Minister Presidents of both Thuringia (Mr. Vogel, CDU) and North Rhine-Westphalia (Mr. Clement, SPD).  Both men spoke out in favor of shoring up the public broadcast system.  </field>

<field name="text">For the first time evidence has appeared to confirm the suspicion that the rise in cases of leukemia in the Schleswig-Holstein community of Elbmarsch has something to do with the Kruemmel nuclear reactor.  A scientific study undertaken by a citizen's group has shown that the community is contaminated with plutonium from the reactor.  According to the report by a scientist from the University of Bremen, in some places the recorded amounts are several times the permissible levels.  The Schleswig-Holstein Environmental Minister will look into the charges.  </field>

<field name="text">Oil from the damaged freighter Pallas is again being driven against the shore of the North Frisian islands.  The beaches could be covered with oil all over again, said a spokeswoman of the Schleswig-Holstein Environmental Ministry.  Fires on the Pallas have not been completely extinguished, but despite that, more oil is being pumped out.  Up 600 tons of heavy and diesel oils still remain in the wreck.  </field></doc></add>

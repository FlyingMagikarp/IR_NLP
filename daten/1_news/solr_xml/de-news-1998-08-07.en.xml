<field name="text">The governing CDU/CSU parties apparently came out strongly in favour of cutting down on immigration, according to a so far unpublished party paper. According to the newspaper RHEINISCHE POST, the paper stated that whoever wanted more people to enter and settle in our densely populated country, would put internal stability and peace at risk. Illegal immigrants should only receive the bare minimum, according to the report. The paper apparently also was against dual citizenship. If someone wanted to take out German citizenship, they would have to give up their former one  </field>

<field name="text">Head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group Schaeuble refuted speculations he would not be available as successor to Chancellor Helmut Kohl any more.

<field name="text">If the SPD's candidate becomes Chancellor in the upcoming elections, the Greens will be the first Mr Schroeder will want to talk to about forming a coalition government. Only in case they could not come to an agreement, would he start talking to the CDU/CSU parties straight away. As he reiterated from his holiday home on the island of Borkum/North Sea, he would rather deal with Defence Minister Ruehe than head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group Schaeuble - if there was to be a big coalition (between SPD and CDU/CSU).  </field>

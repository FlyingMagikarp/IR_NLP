<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder apparently changed tack in the controversy about pension reform. The plan to index pension-rises to the rate of inflation for the next two years, is to be treated separately from the rest of the budget-cutting exercise. This would mean that the current Read-Green coalition's majority in the Lower House (Bundestag) would be sufficient to pass the law - no need for the Upper House (Bundesrat) to get involved, where majorities are uncertain. In the latter, the state of Saarland, among others, had already voiced concerns.  According to government spokesperson Heye, the package-deal containing budget-cuts will not be revisited. In the afternoon he refuted claims by the press that Chancellor Schroeder planned to get the pension-reform passed by the Lower House (Bundestag), but not by the Upper House (Bundesrat). The planned pension-reform had been criticised quite vehemently by the unions and welfare groups.  </field>

<field name="text">In view of falling membership-numbers, the union for construction, agriculture and the environment decided on a radical reorganisation. At a special congress, a vast majority of the delegates voted for abolishing the twelve state organisations. At the same time, the federal organisation will be extended and grouped by industry-sectors. Head of the union Wiesehuegel expects that this will cause his organisation to become closer to what's happening at the pit-face. He also said that the union suffered from falling membership-numbers, not enough young people and falling revenue. Currently the union has 600,000 members, down from 720,000 in 1996.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the automobile association ADAC, high-octane petrol went up by .08 marks in Munich during the last four weeks, and the situation was similar in Nurnberg and Hamburg. Prices, however, were markedly lower in Magdeburg and Dresden. The ADAC thinks that the substantial rises are not only due to the rising cost of oil; they claim that oil-companies also shelter behind the recent tax-rises to boost their own margins.  </field></doc></add>

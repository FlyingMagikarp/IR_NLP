<field name="text">The former minister of construction, Toepfer, wants to pay back 500,000 DEM to the federal government. He received the compensation for his move to a position with the UN. The CDU politician said in Bonn that this was his personal decision and that did not change the legality of this payment. Opposing this view, the parliamentary secretary-general of the SPD- faction in the Bundestag, Struck, announced that the procedure did not comply with budget regulations. The payment was intended to compensate for income losses resulting from Toepfer's new job as an executive director of the UN's environmental organization in Nairobi. The money was paid out of the budget of the Foreign Ministry. Its speaker confirmed that over the past years two high-ranking German officials had received a combined total of about one million DEM for their move to the UN.  </field>

<field name="text">In the Vatican's opinion, the Catholic Church bears no co-responsibility for the Nazi genocide of the Jewish population. According to a declaration of the papal commission for relations to the Jews, the unspeakable tragedy of the holocaust had its roots outside of Christianity. However, Christians would have to face the reproach that they had not done everything humanly possible to save persecuted Jews. The Catholic Church asked for forgiveness for the mistakes of its followers. Israel's high rabbi, Lau, demanded a clear apology from the Vatican for the lack of resistance against the Nazi mass murder. The declaration published today only referred to the attitude of the Catholic Church to the persecution of Jews in general. In Lau's opinion, an open condemnation could have prevented terrible events during World War II.  </field>

<field name="text">The Postdam Regional Court passed sentences on two young right-wing extremists who attacked black British construction workers in Mahlow. They were sentenced to eight and five years in prison. The court considered it established that an accident last June was caused by the men aged 18 and 24.  They chased the British workers and threw a rock at their car, causing serious injuries when the workers' car hit a tree and overturned. One of the victims is now paraplegic.  In his reasoning, the presiding judge pointed out increasing xenophobia among adolescents, saying it was growing increasingly open and aggressive. He also chided the federal constitutional protection agency. The agency had stated only this year that rightwing violence had consolidated to a fairly low level. Judge Czibilla warned that this was not true, hinting at the presence of many youth with shaved heads who crowded the courtroom's public section. They commented on the sentence with impudent calls of "This can't be true" before leaving the courtroom.  </field>

<field name="text">The German mail service corporation (Deutsche Post AG) was granted permission to raise the cost of mailing letters and postcards on September 1, 1997. The decision was made by the federal and state postal regulation council in Bonn. After the increase, stamps for a letter will cost 1.1 marks and postcard stamps will cost one mark. Additional service such as registered mail, valuable mail, or express mail, will become more expensive, as will the mailing of larger letters. The Post AG hopes to make an additional 800 billion marks per year. The decision was preceded by fierce debates regarding postage and plans to close unprofitable post offices. FDP and SPD had opposed an earlier increase.  </field>

<field name="text">Russia again expressed opposition to plans to extend NATO to the east. At the OSCE summit in Lisbon, minister president Chernomyrdin said his country opposes NATO plans to move the organization in the direction of Russia. In a written statement, Russian president Yeltsin warned against a new separation of Europe. US vice president Gore advocated an agreement between NATO and Russia. Speaking on ZDF TV, German foreign minister Kinkel also called for a continued integration of Russia, saying this was the central and strategically decisive question at the conference. Kinkel stated that there would be no peace and quiet and no sufficient security for everybody in Europe without Russia.  Chancellor Kohl supported the integration of Russia in a new security structure. He also called on the OSCE members to approach Eastern Europe in more ways than before, saying the western border of Poland was unacceptable as the permanent eastern border of the European Union. Kohl emphasized that Russia and the Ukraine had to find places appropriate to their size and significance within a unifying Europe.  </field>

<field name="text">The social association VDK has accused the federal government of preparing a reduction of the pension level by presenting survey results on the fast increase of retirees' incomes. The head of the association, Hirlinger (sp?), criticized that the CDU/CSU/FDP coalition was trying to find an excuse for a radical pension reduction with the help of an irresponsible hodgepodge of numbers. Hirlinger referred to a survey commissioned by the federal ministry of employment. Published last weekend, it says that the incomes of old age pensioners in Germany had increased faster than workers' incomes. The CDU had reacted to the survey by saying that it indicated margins for a lowering of the pension level.  </field>

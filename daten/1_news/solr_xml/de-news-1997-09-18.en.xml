<field name="text">A radical Islamic organization based in the United Kingdom has blamed the Egyptian government for the attack on a tourist bus in Cairo. The so-called Islamic Monitoring Center warned tourists to stay away from Egypt as long as the governing regime didn't discontinue its policy of violence against the country's population. Ten people, amongst them at least seven Germans, were killed during the attack which took place near the Egyptian Museum in the center of Cairo. Three assailants were arrested after a shoot-out with police. According to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior one of the arrested is mentally retarded and had been involved in a previous attack on tourists. The German vacationers were from Saxony-Anhalt. Their names have not yet been released.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl and French President Chirac have met for top-level talks in Weimar. The meeting marks the 70th occasion of consultations of this kind between French and German officials. After the initial reception, hosts and guests, which included French Prime Minister Jospin and six ministers from both sides, went on a walking tour of the city's historic district and also visited the Goethe House. There was sporadic booing and jeering from a crowd of more than 1000 bystanders. Talks center mainly on European currency issues as well as the expansion and reform of the European Union. The German and French governments also want to coordinate their approach to the European summit on employment in November in Luxembourg. Also on the agenda in Weimar are issues of cultural cooperation and joint armament projects.  </field>

<field name="text">The governing Coalition and the opposition have held another round of talks in Bonn aimed at finding a last-minute resolution to the ongoing conflict over the tax reform. Representatives of both sides explored chances of a compromise during sessions of the standing committee of arbitration between the Upper and Lower Houses of the German Federal Parliament. During the last couple of days, both CDU and FDP, as well as the SPD, had indicated their willingness to compromise whilst reiterating their previous positions. Therefore, coalition plans for a comprehensive tax reform agenda are given only little chance of success. A limited solution along the lines of a reduction of fringe wage costs coupled with a simultaneous increase in the value-added tax is considered unlikely. Without achieving any results negotiations were adjourned to next Thursday.  </field>

<field name="text">The United Nations (UN) helicopter that crashed yesterday in Bosnia-Herzegovina smashed into a mountain after straying into banks of fog. This preliminary result of investigations was released in Sarajevo. Speculation that the helicopter had come under fire could not be confirmed. Twelve occupants of the illfated aircraft were killed in the accident, amongst them five Germans, five US-Americans, one Briton and one Polish national. Amongst the German crash victims was Gerd Wagner, deputy UN commissioner for Bosnia, as well as Thomas Reinhard, a senior official with the German Department of Foreign Affairs, who had commenced duty in Sarajevo only this week.

<field name="text">The crash of a German air force Tupolev aircraft in the South Atlantic threatens to strain relations between Germany and Namibia. Yesterday, the Namibian government in Windhoek again denied having received a detailed flight plan from the German air force. Furthermore, Namibia added that it was not prepared to be made the scapegoat for the accident. The German Ministry of Defense, however, reiterated in Bonn that officials in Namibia had in fact been informed of the aircraft's intention to touch down in Windhoek. Meanwhile, search teams off the Namibian coastline yesterday recovered the largest chunk of wreckage found so far, although it remains unclear to which of the two aircraft that allegedly collided it belongs.  </field>

<field name="text">The chair of the union for metal, electronics, and engineering, Mr. Zwickel, welcomed a key draft on economic policy that the SPD executive board will put forward at the party's next federal conference. He explained that the draft stood for innovation, reform and optimism about the future. Mr. Zwickel called upon the SPD to give the unions an active part in developing the party's economic program. Particularly a policy for more employment would be essential, said Mr. Zwickel. The SPD executive board holds that salaries ought not to be taxable, and that the government should subsidize low incomes.  </field>

<field name="text">The head of the German delegation to the Oslo Anti-Land mines Conference, Mr. Hartmann, has criticized the rejectionist position adopted by the US towards the negotiated treaty. In an interview with "Deutschlandradio Berlin," Mr. Hartmann said that the US stance constituted a handicap with regard to the future inclusion of other countries, especially that of major land mine manufacturers China and Russia. No one anticipates that the United States will ratify the treaty in the near future, said Mr. Hartmann. 88 countries present in Oslo agreed to the draft agreement on a worldwide ban on anti-personnel land mines. US President Clinton justified his rejection of the treaty by pointing to the agreement's non-inclusion of any exemption clauses. He added that his government would now seek to reach an agreement within the framework of the UN Disarmament Conference in Geneva.  </field>

<field name="text">Part-time employees within the public sector are to receive improved protection against unlawful dismissal. A ruling by the German Federal Labor Court in Kassel states that long-term employees who work less than half the regular weekly hours, are irremovable. A clause in the public service's industrial award agreement, stipulating at least half-time employment as a prerequisite for irremovability, was unconstitutional, the judges said.  </field>

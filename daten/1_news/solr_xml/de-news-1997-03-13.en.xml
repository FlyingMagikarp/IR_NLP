<field name="text">A compromise has been reached in the dispute over proposed cuts in subsidies to the coal industry. Under the agreement there should be no compulsory lay-offs. The financial assistance provided by the Federal Government and the states is to be reduced from approximately 9 billion DM to 5.5 billion by the year 2005. This will result in the gradual elimination of about 48,000 of the current 85,000 jobs in the mining industry. Once the agreement between Chancellor Kohl and the head of the Union of Mineworkers, Mr. Berger, had been announced, the miners ended their protest action.  The coalition government, the opposition parties and the German Federation of Trade Unions all expressed their satisfaction with the compromise. Approximately 8,000 miners from the Saarland region of Germany spent last night in Cologne, eagerly awaiting the outcome of the coal summit.  The miners camped out in tents or slept on the floor of local sports halls. Mr. Kohl had indicated yesterday evening, that there was every hope of a compromise.  </field>

<field name="text">Following the compromise over coal subsidies, Ruhrkohle AG (the company responsible for mines in the Ruhr region) has announced that it will decide by the Autumn, which four collieries should close by the year 2000. The most likely candidates for closure are one mine in the Saarland, and three in the Ruhr region, announced the managing director of Ruhrkohle AG, Mr. Neib. The necessary job cuts are to be achieved through the introduction of part-time work, retraining and early retirement, but without compulsory lay-offs. According to Mr. Neib, the take-over of the government-owned sector of the Saar mines by Ruhrkohle could be considered effective from January of this year. The merger was one of the pre-conditions for increased funding from the Federal Government.  </field>

<field name="text">The major private health insurers want to increase premiums. DAK, BEK, TKK and seven other health insurance companies today submitted applications to this effect at the Federal Insurance Agency in Berlin. Increases of less than one percent are planned. As the applications have been submitted before the qualifying date for legal reforms, the increase in premiums will not automatically result in higher deductibles.  In Bonn the Minister for Health, Mr. Seehofer, spoke of a manoeuvre by the insurance companies designed to put pressure on the current discussions about health reforms. He said he would refuse to give in to such pressure.  </field>

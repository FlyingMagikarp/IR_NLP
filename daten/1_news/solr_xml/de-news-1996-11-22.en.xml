<field name="text">The unions HBV and DAG intend to stage strikes and demonstrations to force employers back to the bargaining table, and they want to get fully paid sick-leave. As the latter was not part of the awards, new legislation (introduced recently) will now prevail, effectively reducing paid sick-leave from 100% to 80% of gross pay. The unions expect turn-out to be considerable. Cologne and Leverkusen kicked it off on Monday, when some bank staff stayed at home, and the rest of the country is expected to follow suit during the day. Mr Kalin, of the HBV, said on television that no-one would accept reduced pay lying down. "That's why we tell our members in many cities to take part in industrial action, wildcat-strikes, demonstrations and stop-work meetings - and that's our right, according to the constitution, our's and non-members'. We propose to set up health committees comprising employers, union organisers, company doctors and others to develop initiatives for better health. We think that this would save more money than the .3% employers intend to save by reducing paid sick-leave." The unions want to write that into the awards, and use wildcat-strikes as a means to put pressure on employers, to make them resume negotiations.  </field>

<field name="text">This afternoon the delegates to the 60th CSU party conference in Munich were into discussing principles of their policies leading into the next millennium. The two-day meeting's motto was : "To the future". Controversial issues got the cold shoulder; they discussed items beyond run-of-the-mill politics instead. Neither bickering nor back-stabbing nor personal attacks - all harmony. As Mr Bernd Protzner, Secretary General, said: "In Bavaria as in Germany we have to proceed with reforms and renewal. We will have to stop looking back and moaning about what had been possible in the past. We'll have to develop ideas for the future and talk about solutions to upcoming challenges."  In spite of all the looking-forward, the agenda was like in the past. First, head of the party, Mr Theo Waigel, delivered his speech, then a member of the church did more of the same, and finally Chancellor Helmut Kohl will address the delegates.  </field>

<field name="text">Today military experts from 20 different countries discussed details of a possible military expedition to Eastern Zaire, and they are to reach a final decision about sending soldiers by this weekend. Last week more than half of the 1 million refugees had returned to Rwanda, and that was why there appeared to be no immediate need to send soldiers any more. According to UN-aid organisations, satellite pictures would give the impression that there were still about 700,000 refugees roaming the forests in Eastern Zaire's mountains.  </field>

<field name="text">Several CDU/CSU and FDP members of parliament want diplomatic relations with Iran suspended. Mr Wilhelm, CDU expert for internal affairs, asked for diplomats to be recalled when interviewed by the tabloid BILD. Governments that ordered murders were not to be trusted. On Wednesday, spiritual leaders in Iran had asked for the 'death-sentence' for the three federal prosecutors currently working at the Mykonos trial.  </field>

<field name="text">Complainant Wolfgang Wieland accused the government of having done nothing when they knew that Iran's government had had their fingers in the pie, and that they had preferred to do nothing and hide behind the judiciary instead. No wonder that, given this sort of pussy-footing, Iran issued death-threats in turn.  Meanwhile both sides are trying hard to keep the conflict from escalating any further. As early as yesterday, Chancellor Kohl wrote a letter to Iran's Prime Minister Rafsanchani, asking for moderation. The latter replied today.  Mr Kohl's letter won quite positive acceptance in Teheran. Mr Rafsanchani came to the rescue while saying his prayers on Friday, at the university, explicitly siding with government and Germany against the recent attacks by radical demonstrators in his country (actually using the word 'riots' when referring to what had gone on last week). He appealed to the believers that they should not forget that Germany was not their main enemy, but the USA and Israel, both trying to disturb relations between Teheran and Bonn. For the first time he also admitted that the public prosecutors' and the government's views were two different things. Mr Rafsanchani said that "we are convinced that the majority in Bonn's government does not want any trouble with Iran". Up to now he had refrained from commenting on the issue. He also said that both sides should try and keep the situation under control, and wanted a continued dialogue with Bonn as this would be in the interest of both countries (almost quoting a similar-sounding passage in Mr Kohl's letter).  </field>

<field name="text">The murder of banker Alfred Herrhausen had not been solved so far, even seven years after it had happened, though police always wanted to talk to the number-one suspect, 38-year old Christoph Seitler, whereabouts unknown. He was also alleged to having been a member of the RAF-terrorist organisation. Recently Mr Seitler, who had absconded, refuted both allegations when interviewed by the magazine DER SPIEGEL. He also said that he would give himself up to the public prosecutor, which he did today. This morning he knocked on the Federal Court of Justice's door, and may even leave it tonight, a free man. Meanwhile he intends to prove conclusively, together with his lawyers, that in autumn 1989 he was in a Lebanese camp run by the PLO, so could not have committed the crime. The judge now will have to decide if the arrest-warrant for Mr Seitler will get suspended. Even if he would remain a murder-suspect, they could suspend it, as there was no danger of Mr Seitler's absconding. A man who gives himself up in spite of grave accusations, is unlikely to abscond again just like that.  </field>

<field name="text">Judge Horst Henries, controversial president of the Hesse supreme court, resigned, after having been asked repeatedly to do so - the last time as late as yesterday - because he had caused grave harm to the judiciary. The judge had received a fee of 1.34 million marks for an expert's report commissioned by the metal-workers' union (IG Metall). Originally he had been convinced that he had done nothing wrong, and vigorously refuted allegations. Today he said that he resigned as apparently he did not have the confidence of the majority in Hesse's parliament any more.  </field>

<field name="text">labor Minister Norbert Bluem justified the raise in pension contributions. >From next January on contributions will rise from 20.3% to 21% of the income before taxes, if the Bundesrat does agree.  The raise grieves him too, said Mr. Bluem, but it was necessary. In August and September a dramatic drop in contributions occured, caused, so Mr. Bluem, by early retirement, transformation of social security contribution-liable jobs into DM610-jobs, and, predominantly, high unemployment. Therefore, he called upon employers to hire more people. The government will do their best to prevent the raise.  Bluem stated he was in favor of raising the sales tax. He called upon the Social Democrats to cooperate. The Social-Democrats signaled readiness for discussions. The SPD's federal executive officer Franz Muentefering said, the party had several proposals. Tomorrow, Lower Saxony's State Premier Gerhard Schroeder will propose to raise the sales tax by one percent not in 1999 but as soon as possible.  Today, the Cabinet also approved changes of the stock market code. The changes aim at attracting foreign investors. Additionally, the initiation of data exchange between social security and unemployment offices on one side, and insurers on the other, was decided. This shall help to prevent social security fraud.  </field>

<field name="text">The Cabinet passed a program on emmission reduction. By the year 2005 emmission of carbon dioxide is to be reduced by 25% compared to 1990's amount.  Furthermore, the government will promote renewable energy, improved insulation of buildings, and an increased utilization of power-heat coupling by industries and communities. With regard to the introduction of environmentally responsible technologies Environment Minister Angela Merkel relies on the industry. Social-Democrat Peter Mueller said the federal governments list was just a letter to Santa Claus. In no country was the difference between desire and reality as large as in Germany, said Mueller. The Greens called the government's environmental policy piece-meal stuff and demanded an ecological tax reform.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Social Court dismissed several suits that had been filed against the nursing insurance that was introduced in 1995. The law did not violate the constitution, the judges said. The suits were mostly against the regulation that people do not have a free choice among the insurers. This would cause different contribution rates also for the nursing insurance. The judges rejected these objections. There was a connection between health insurance and nursing insurance because the risk of requiring nursing is a consequence of the health risk.  </field>

<field name="text">The legal status of Scientology in Germany remains unclear. The Federal Administrative Court in Berlin today repealed the verdict of a lower court. The Mannheim Administrative Court had declared Scientology to be mainly a business-oriented institution, but did not touch its status as a registered association arguing that Scientology might also be a religious community. The judges in Berlin called upon the lower court to check whether Scientology's main purpose is indeed to make business. Then the status as a registered association could be withdrawn, no matter if Scientology is a religious community or not. This case was about a Scientology section in Stuttgart.  </field>

<field name="text">Immediate dismissal of double bass player Gerd Reinke (sp?) was confirmed by a Berlin labour court. Last May, Reinke signed a bill with "Adolf Hitler" while on concert tour in Israel. The musician had been employed by the "Deutsche Oper" for 20 years; immediate and outright dismissal is a very heavy penalty - said the presiding judge. But it was the only action that could have been taken. Reinke is fully responsible for the whole affair and must bear this responsibility. His "Hitler"- signature gravely impaired the good name of the Opera and of Berlin State. The musician considered the sentence to be very heavy. He said he had hoped to be able to return to work at the Opera - now he will have to let things drift and try to muddle through.  </field>

<field name="text">Finance minister Eichel has rejected the union's tax plan. Eichel said that the resulting high national debt is not acceptable. "Only those who are not responsible for the national finances, can present such a proposal", said Eichel in response to the union's tax proposals. Eichel calculated that the first step alone would create a budget deficit of 18 billion DM. After the union, on their part, criticised the government's savings and tax plans as unsuitable, the two fronts are set for the parliamentary debates in the Bundesrat and the mediation committee. In all probability, the decision on the tax plan of the future will be made there.  </field>

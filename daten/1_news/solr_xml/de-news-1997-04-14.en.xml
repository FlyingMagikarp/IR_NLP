<field name="text">The key points of a pension reform drawn out by experts of the governing coalition over the weekend has been rejected by the parties of the opposition, the unions and welfare associations.  The experts for social policy of the SPD and The Greens cautioned against an increase of old-age poverty if the pension levels were decreased from 70% to 64% [of a person's last salary] by 2015, as called for in the bill.  The social welfare organization VdK threatened to bring the case before the Federal Constitutional Court if today's retirees face cuts.  On the eve of a Coalition meeting with Chancellor Kohl tomorrow, the leaderships of FDP and CDU/CSU have welcomed the bill which would ensure that pension contributions remain below 20% in the long term.  FDP chairman Mr. Gerhard, however, warned that his party would not agree to a mere shifting of cost in which the pension contributions are lessened, but at the same time consumer taxes would have to be raised.  </field>

FDP politicians, however, cautioned against giving up the Coalition's tax proposal and called on the SPD to present concrete suggestions in questions such as cutting costs in the welfare system.  </field>

At the National Drug Convention in Erfurt, experts cautioned against a reduction of the capacity of rehabilitation facilities.  About 750 of a total of 5,000 therapy spaces could be cut, because the Federal Government and the Health Insurers are slashing funds.  The Professional Association for Drugs estimates that 2.5 million people in Germany are alcohol addicted.  About 300,000 people in Germany are addicted to illegal drugs.  Out of DM 28 billion in revenue from alcohol and tobacco taxes, the government spends only DM 30 million for the battle against addiction, the association explained.  </field>

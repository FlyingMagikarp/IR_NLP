<field name="text">Federal Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer gave his two-day visit to Turkey a positive assessment. In his words, Berlin and Ankara had begun a new chapter in their relations. They had many common interests, he said, as do Europe and Turkey - it was harder and harder to keep them apart. He added that there was a great deal of agreement and that the two countries had similar ways of describing the problems. The federal government plans to help Turkey in its efforts to be formally granted member candidate status at the EU summit in Helsinki at the end of the year. Fischer also brought up Turkey's human rights record in his discussions and pressed for a peaceful settlement to their problem with the Kurds.  </field>

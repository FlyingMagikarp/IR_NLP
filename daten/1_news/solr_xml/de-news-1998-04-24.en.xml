<field name="text">The Euro is here to stay: today the Upper House (Bundesrat) agreed, with a large majority of their votes, to introduce a common currency in Germany and 10 more EU-member states. The only federal state to vote against the planned kickoff of the new currency on 1 January 1999, was Saxony, who had always said they would be against.  Now it will be farewell to the German mark, and that's final, as the last parliamentary institution, namely the Upper House (Bundesrat), also voted for it. Saxony stuck with their no, as they were concerned about the stability of the new currency. During a previous debate lasting for 4 1/2 hours, Chancellor Kohl confirmed that the Euro would not be a soft touch: "Germany's government has achieved, by sheer doggedness, that the so-called Maastricht criteria will be followed to the letter. According to the regulations, the community will not be responsible for debts of member-states, and there is no provision for additional transfer-payments." Mr Lafontaine, Saarland's Premier, sees things a bit differently: "Concentrating solely on a stable currency and a common monetary policy would be short-sighted, and might have quite expensive consequences. If there is no common economic, fiscal, tax and wages policy, then there will be transfer-payments, regardless of the treaty. Reality would displace a treaty, and that's happened more than a few times in history."  Saxony's Premier Biedenkopf voted against, as he thought that Belgium's and Italy's pledges to save would not be sufficient (they carry quite a bit of public debt). Admitting them without additional commitments, would be a problem, from an economic viewpoint. That's why the general population will keep having their doubts about the whole matter.  </field>

<field name="text">After last week's public bickering, top-level politicians of the CDU and CSU parties now closed ranks once again. When they met at the Chancellor's office this morning, they agreed on a common plan and strategy for the upcoming elections. If they win, this would be the basis for government policies for the next 4 years.  CDU and CSU want to start electioneering together - after having had a bit of a tiff recently. Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU: "We are facing the new challenges together, and we agree on the issues. And we have agreed to develop a common platform for this election." Allegedly they have put paid to the controversy about an energy-tax. And there is no more talk about who will succeed Chancellor Kohl. According to Bavaria's Premier Stoiber: "Helmut Kohl is the CDU/CSU's candidate, and let it be known that any discussion about that would hurt our chances, but we want to win, don't we." Leading CDU/CSU politicians also refuted rumours that some CDU members of parliament had tried to talk Mr Kohl into withdrawing.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Minister for Youth Nolte asked for stricter measures against child-pornography and sex-tourism. When showing an informative video, she reminded viewers that in Germany every six minutes a child of less than 14 years of age would be subject to sexual abuse. The offenders mostly are friends or relatives, according to the minister. Ms Nolte: "No-one is to look away when they suspect or even see such things happening around them."  </field>

<field name="text">In spite of sales-tax having gone up as of 1 April, the consumer price-index has only risen slightly. Inflation went up by .2%, compared to last month's figures, according to the Federal Statistical Agency (Statistisches Bundesamt). The yearly inflation rate therefore could be as low as 1.3%.  </field></doc></add>

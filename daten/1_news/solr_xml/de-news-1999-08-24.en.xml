<field name="text">The SPD faction of the Bundestag and the unions have not been able to come to an agreement about the government's plans for the pension system. After a four-hour talk in the Reichstag the president of the SPD faction Peter Struck said that the two parties remained firm on their positions. Struck announced that the Cabinet would decide tomorrow that for the next two years, pensions would be raised only in line with inflation rate [and not in line with average income increases]. However, he did not want to exclude that plans might change. More talks with the unions are planned while the bill is passed into law. Immediately before the talks, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder made clear that the government would remain firm on its plan to raise pensions only in line with inflation rate. The vice-president of the employees union, Freitag, however said in a radio interview that he thought there was still room for negotiations in the pension discussion.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel and President of the German central bank (Bundesbank) Hans Tietmeyer have agreed on a compromise about the disputed revaluation of Bundesbank's gold and foreign currency reserves. After a meeting in Bonn of the CDU/CSU faction in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) Mr Waigel said a good compromise has been made. Bundesbank's board of directors (Zentralbankrat) still has to approve the deal. The revaluation of the gold and foreign currency reserves will be done gradually beginning with this year's balance sheet.  CDU/CSU faction leader Wolfgang Schaeuble said the proposal has been welcomed within the CDU and the CSU. The dispute between the CDU/CSU and the FDP about this year's budget and tax rates has not been settled though. Faction and party leaders discussed the issue again in the Chancellor's Office this morning. The FDP stressed again that they reject tax increases to plug gaps in the deficit. In the afternoon, the factions of all three parties in the Bundestag discussed budget policies.  </field>

<field name="text">The German central bank (Bundesbank) does not take for granted the anticipated starting date for the European monetary union. It turned out that for some countries, including Germany, the criteria set for joining the common currency are harder to fulfil than assumed only a little while ago, said the member of Bundesbank's board of directors, Mr Meister (sp?). He warned against "creative accounting" measures that do not have any positive real consequences. The criteria for joining the monetary union had to be applied strictly. The time pressure of the anticipated date January 1, 1999 should not lead to neglect of the stability of the Euro [the future European currency].  On the other hand, the Federation of German banks warned against the possibility of the European monetary union being canceled due to a too strict interpretation of the stability criteria. The managing director, Mr Weber, said it would be disastrous if the Euro failed because of a German budget deficit of 3.2 per cent. Mr Weber added that the Federal government could not ignore the necessity of further cuts, for example in the social services sector, and of further privatisations [of state owned companies].  </field>

<field name="text">Negotiations on reforming the industry-wide collective bargaining agreement in the West German chemical sector seems to have reached a deadlock.

<field name="text">Bank customers have better protection now when dealing with stocks. The Federal Office for Bank Supervision published new guidelines today. According to these guidelines, banks have to tell customers the risks of the different stock market deals. Recommendations by banks that might turn out disadvantageous for customers are forbidden. For the protection of customers, so-called "front-running" has been out-lawed as well. This means that banks are not allowed to buy stocks before recommending it or before fulfilling an order of a customer.  </field>

<field name="text">The Green party conference has decided that the party's traditional separation of office and mandate (which means that a member cannot hold a leadership position while acting as the direct representative for a set of constituents, or vice-versa) will be partially lifted. In the future, elected representatives or government members will be able to belong to the party's federal executive. A final decision on the issue can only be made at the general party conference in Karlsruhe in March, with a two-thirds majority vote. The committee of state-level Green party administrations (Laenderrat) in Magdeburg also agreed to replace the Party Council (Parteirat) with a sixteen-member Presidential Committee (Praesidium), and to enlarge the Federal Executive from five to six members. At present, the Party Council has twenty-five members. The Greens hope the new committee will be more effective. Participants at the conference called for an immediate end to the war in Chechenya. They also want the European Union to look into applying sanctions against Russia.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the deputy caucus leader for the CDU/CSU, Juergen Ruettgers, the prospect of forming state governments in coalition with the Greens is no longer a taboo topic. Ruettgers told the "Welt am Sonntag" newspaper that cooperation was a possibility even outside of municipal politics. For his own state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where he is head of the CDU, however, Ruettgers ruled out the possibility of such a coalition following the next state elections there in May.  </field>

<field name="text">CDU leader Wolfgang Schaeuble and party Secretary-General Angela Merkel have joined in  with the demands of other important CDU politicians that the party discuss matters of policy with the PDS in order to emphasize their differences. The leader of the "Young Union" youth wing of the party, Hildegard Mueller, supports the move as well, saying, at the Young Union's national conference, that the PDS phenomenon could only be fought if other parties differentiated their positions clearly, and offered young Germans different perspectives. An executive member of the PDS, Michael Schumann, welcomed the announcement of policy discussions. He told the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper that that would allow an opportunity to raise the subject of the real problems facing Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">The executive of the Young Union (JU), the youth wing of the CDU/CSU, has failed in its attempt to secure improved legal status for homosexual partnerships. At its national conference in Weimar, Young Union delegates voted to delete the corresponding clause from the conference agenda. The leadership committee of the JU will now discuss the question internally. The youth wing's mother parties, CDU and CSU, had earlier made it clear that they were very critical of the idea of improving the legal status of same-sex couples.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Book Trade's Peace Prize (Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels) has been awarded to historian Fritz Stern. The 73-year-old German-American was given the prize in the Paulskirche church in Frankfurt for his life's work. The jury decided that Stern had served peace through building bridges of understanding between different peoples and times. Stern has written about German and European history and about the Jews. In his acceptance speech, he said that even in a reunified Germany with Berlin as its capital, history could not be considered a closed book. He said there was a need for responsibility, arising from the knowledge of the crimes of the past. Stern said the victims could be honoured by keeping their stories alive through historical research. He said that task was being pursued in a notable way in today's Germany. Stern also appealed for the internal reunification of Germany, calling it a condition for political stability.  </field>

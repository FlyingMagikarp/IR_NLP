<field name="text">The planned peace-keeping force for Kosovo is to be enlarged. The NATO Council has thus agreed to meet the desires of the military leadership. Rather than 28,000 soldiers, as previously intended, 45,000 to 50,000 will now make up the force. The exact composition of the group, being called KFOR, is not yet clear. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer discussed the matter with his American counterpart, Madeleine Albright, today. The force will be sent in when the war in Kosovo has ended. Its mission will be to supervise the return of refugees to their homes.  </field>

<field name="text">The employment pact which is expected to be passed at the EU summit next week does not contain any hard data on the hoped-for reduction in unemployment. Speaking in Brussels at the closing round of talks with his European counterparts from both labour and finance ministries, German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said that such figures were not really meaningful anyway. He said they would only serve to invite setting the lowest possible goals. The draft proposal for the employment pact, which was discussed today, named reducing unemployment as the number one priority in the European Union. To that end, the EU heads of government and heads of state want to work towards a better dialogue between the national governments, unions and managements, and the European Central Bank when they meet again in early June.  </field>

<field name="text">The hundred-year flood of Lake Constance may not have peaked yet. Meteorologists are forecasting thunderstorms and high winds in the region tonight. Experts also expect more spring run-off from melting snow in the Alps due to warmer temperatures. The shores of the county of Konstanz, in particular, are the scene of intense preparations for rising water levels. The level there was measured at 5.63 metres this evening. Fire, ambulance, and police forces are preparing for action if and when the water does rise further. In communities on Lake Constance, many lakeside roads are already under water. Shipping is severely restricted.  </field>

<field name="text">The employers in the textile industry today presented an offer in wage contract talks. The offer is for 2.9 percent more money for employees. A spokesman for the IG Metall union, however, was quite skeptical about the offer, saying that it was an insufficient basis on which to form a deal. He said that the minimum acceptable offer would start with a "3" in front of the decimal place.  </field>

<field name="text">The Constitutional Court has reached a verdict in the lawsuit regarding the shut-down of the nuclear power plant at Muehlheim-Kehrlich.  The judges of Karlsruhe have upheld the damage claim and fixed the recompense at DM 1.5 billion.  It is now for the lower court, the Karlsruhe Higher Regional Court, to decide what amount of payment the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is obliged to.  However, the ruling by the Constitutional Court requires an investigation as to whether RWE is partially responsible that a preliminary permit of operation for the power plant was issued, even though in 1988 it turned out that the permit had been illegal.  The finding reached today furthermore states that RWE is not entitled to damages in all the points it had filed for.  </field>

<field name="text">In unanimous vote, the Senior Council of the Bundestag has exonerated Parliamentary President Ms. Suessmuth from accusations of having used the air transportation corps of the Bundeswehr for private purposes.  The Council thereby endorsed the report by Parliamentary Vice President Klose. Mr. Klose (SPD) had investigated the charges against Ms. Suessmuth in detail.  The Senior Council proposed to revise the regulations governing the Bundeswehr's air transportation service.  The so-called risk analysis of politicians has to be brought up-to-date.  The security authorities estimate to what extent a Member of Parliament is at risk and may hence use Bundeswehr aircraft for transportation.  </field>

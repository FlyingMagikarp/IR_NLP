<field name="text">It is the largest military action since the end of World War II. KFOR troops are marching into Kosovo, including 200 Bundeswehr soldiers who are on the way to their base in Prisren. Tomorrow morning, an additional 1,200 Bundeswehr soldiers are expected. Not only KFOR troupes but also 200 Russian soldiers have marched to Prisren and set up camp in a night lightning operation. NATO has criticized this action. Now, NATO General Jackson has landed in Pristina to negotiate with the Russian commander. It is unclear in what way the Russians are working with the KFOR force. Negotiations on Russia's role continue.  When the entire peace-keeping force reaches its positions, the next step is to rebuild Kosovo. Germany will certainly be involved in this process but taxes will not be increased to do so. This was promised by Federal Finance Minister Eichel after the G-7 meeting of finance ministers in Frankfurt. In addition, Mr. Eichel warned against allocating a lot of money at this early stage for rebuilding Kosovo. "Do not misunderstand me--it is not that the finance ministers are being tight-fisted. Rather, we want to ensure that the money reaches the right people and can be used to achieve the desired purposes," stated Mr. Eichel. According to the finance minister, the fist reliable estimates on the costs to rebuild will be available in the fall at the earliest.  </field>

<field name="text">The finance ministers of the seven leading industrial nations have begun their meeting in Frankfurt am Main. Some key areas to be addressed are financial issues and international debt management. The Russian minister Michael Kasyanov is also expected. The finance ministers are also preparing for the  summit between G7 state and government leaders and Russia to take place next weekend. "This is not to be an academic discussion," noted Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin in the context of the meeting. Reforms are on the agenda and the ministers want to adapt the world financial system to a new architecture for the 21st century.  One issue on the agenda is a plan for the debt remission of the forty poorest countries in the world. It is believed that this issue is the most likely to garner support from all sides. On the other hand, a more more sensitive issue is Kosovo an the role Russia is to play. According to US President Clinton, the Europeans should pay the majority of costs necessary to rebuild Kosovo. This request was rejected by the Europeans as hasty.  More credit for Russia's suffering economy are not expected. However, it is clear that Russia's role as an intermediary in the Kosovo crisis should be rewarded in one way or another.  Twenty months ago, the collapse of the Thai currency caused a world-wide financial crisis from which many countries have not fully recovered. The G7 ministers are trying to develop some comprehensive financial defense mechanisms to avoid such scenarios in the future. The IMF and the World Bank should play a role in this process.  </field>

<field name="text">The scandal of dioxin-contaminated foodstuffs from Belgium has now expanded to include other poisons.  In North Rhine-Westfalia, inspectors have discovered polychlorinated biphenyls, commonly known as PCBs, in Belgian eggs.  These chemicals are used in hydraulic machinery, among other things. They are very poisonous and can damage the human nervous and metabolic systems.  Although only a few eggs were badly affected, the Ministry in Bonn intends to conduct wider tests to ascertain the level of PCBs in Belgian foodstuffs in general.  Federal Health Minister Karl-Heinz Funke is deliberating whether Germany should demand damages for both the spoiled goods and the cost of inspections.  </field>

<field name="text">The unions have called for beefed-up warning strikes in the wake of the failed third round of wage negotiations in the Bavarian retail sector. The biggest strikes were in Franconia, and especially in Nuremberg.  Over 600 employees involved in retail are supposed to have taken part in the protest actions.  The Kaufhof and Karstatt stores in both downtown Nuremberg and in Langwasser were affected.  A spokesman for the Union of Retail, Bank and Insurance Workers said that the walkouts would continue at least through noon.  </field>

<field name="text">According to a story in "Der Spiegel," neither corporations nor individual entrepreneurs will be able to deduct entertainment expenses in the future. This step would bring around a billion marks into the Treasury, and is part of a budget package that Hans Eichel, the Finance Minister, is planning to use to offset lower corporate taxes, according to the magazine.  In addition, "Der Spiegel" forecast that several agricultural tax breaks would be rescinded, included reduced prices for diesel fuel.  </field>

<field name="text">The German cup winner was determined today in Berlin during a thrilling game between Bayern Muenchen and SV Werder Bremen. The score remained 1:1 after 90 minutes - and stayed that way after 120 minutes as well. Mario Basler, who had already established himself in the first half as enfant terrible, was forced to leave the field with a yellow-red card in the 114th minute. During the first five 11-meter penalty kicks, Todt from Werder Bremen and Effenberg from Bayern Muenchen missed their shots. After the SV Werder goalkeeper Rost, who had played excellently the entire game, scored during his penalty kick, Lothar Matthaeus became the goat of the game. Rost's penalty shot allowed Werder Bremen to win the game 6:5.  </field>

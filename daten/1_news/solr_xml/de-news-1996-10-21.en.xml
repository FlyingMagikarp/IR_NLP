<field name="text">The national convention of the CDU party began in Hanover today. Chancellor Helmut Kohl opened the two-day conference with a speech stating principles. Yesterday, the CDU chairman had called on the more than one thousand representatives to agree to the women's quota. The proposal, intended to give female CDU members a more proportionate share of CDU positions, had been rejected at last year's convention. The party meeting will also focus on board elections and tax policy. Mr. Wulf, chairman of the CDU in Lower Saxony, again emphasized his party's intention to lower taxes. He told Deutschlandfunk radio that the Christian Democrats are working towards a net relief of up to 30 billion marks. In order to finance the program, even more severe austerity measures and the dismantling of privileges would be necessary, Wulf said. He rejected the idea of increasing the VAT rates.  By evening, the CDU had concluded elections to some top party offices. Michel Friedman, a member of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, did not succeed in the run for a seat on the federal board. The former minister of mail and telecommunications, Schwarz- Schilling, also failed. The minister president of Thuringia, Vogel, achieved the best result, gaining 86.3 percent of votes. Earlier, Chancellor Kohl had been confirmed in his position as CDU chairman, receiving 95.5 percent of the delegates' votes. The convention also accepted a proposal to improve protection from sexual abuse of children, supported a call to have the Scientology church observed by the federal agency for the protection of the constitution, and postponed a vote on a proposal to facilitate the naturalization of immigrants.  </field>

<field name="text">The minister of agriculture of Lower Saxony, Mr. Funke, called on the European Union to provide balance payments for cattle-raising countries. In an interview with Deutschlandradio Berlin, the SPD politician said that the developments in the cattle markets were disastrous. He said that the decline in beef consumption by 15 to 20 percent as a consequence of Mad Cow's Disease (BSE) posed a serious risk to farmers raising cattle. Funke held the European Union responsible because it had failed to judge the problem realistically for a long time and had not taken appropriate measures.  </field>

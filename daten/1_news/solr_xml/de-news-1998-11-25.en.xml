<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder and DGB-chief Schulte have affirmed their commitment to the success of the Employment Alliance. Schroeder said that the discussions taking place at the beginning of December should create a climate of confidence. All sides will have to make concessions. On the subject of the "620-DM jobs", Schroeder said the reorganization will take place as he has previously outlined. The trade unions, however, still have issues to be discussed. The DGB fears that these new conditions of employment will be expanded. As for criticism from business owners regarding the new Red-Green tax plan, the Chancellor said he saw no reason to fundamentally alter the plan.

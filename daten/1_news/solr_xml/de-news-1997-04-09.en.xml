<field name="text">The suggestion put forward by Zwickel, the leader of the IG Metall union, that a 32 hour week should be introduced as of 1999, with no accompanying adjustment in wages, has met with little support from the ruling coalition or from employers' organisations. Hundt, the president of one employers' organisation, stressed that it would be wrong to continue reducing the working week as a means of fighting unemployment; Zwickel's ideas would merely result in a kind of "shortage management." Hausmann, a government spokesman, reacted cautiously to the suggestion. He said that it was interesting, but not all of the details had been made public yet. Schaeuble, the leader of the CDU parliamentary group in the Bundestag, said that there was no shortage of work in Germany, but rather the problem is that it is too expensive to employ people, so it is unlikely that new jobs would be created if hours were cut,as this might cause wage-costs to rise even more. Rexrodt, the federal minister of economics, also rejected the idea, and called instead for more flexible working patterns. Zwickel's suggestion did find some support, though - from Oskar Lafontaine, the leader of the SPD, and from Schulte, the leader of the German Trade Union Federation, who said that the idea would provide an opportunity to discuss the chances of success of this type of strategy. He said that it would certainly bring new life into the discussion.  </field>

<field name="text">In connection with the Thomy extortion case, the police have been desperately searching for poisoned groceries at a 'Lidl' supermarket. A spokesman for the police said that he feared that some of the poisoned goods had already been bought. By the afternoon, no tampered-with products had been found at the branch of Lidl, unlike at the 'Plus' supermarket in Saarbruecken and the 'Condi' supermarket in Regensburg, where tubes of mustard had been poison with hydrocyanic acid; these three stores had been expressly named by the extortionist. The police are still searching the third store. The products that had been tampered with are still being examined. The Nestle company, which owns the firm Thomy, has already said that it will pay the extortionists if necessary in order to protect its customers, but there has been no contact between the company and the extortionists, according to a company spokesman, nor is the amount which the extortionists have demanded known.  </field>

<field name="text">A 59 year old pensioner has been given a five year jail sentence because of his attempts to blackmail the 'Aldi' supermarket chain and a millionaire's family in Duesseldorf. While pronouncing the sentence at the Regional Court in Essen, the judge emphasised his opinion that it is particularly despicable to blackmail shops which sell food, as it is almost impossible for them to protect themselves against such threats. The convicted man had threatened last summer to poison food-stuffs in 'Aldi' shops unless the firm paid him a million Swiss francs.  </field>

<field name="text">Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, has said that Germany's safety and international safety in general can only be guaranteed through disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. After the federal cabinet adopted the 14th yearly report on disarmament today, Kinkel spoke about the treaty which forbids any testing of atomic weapons, saying that 142 countries have signed the treaty, including the five atomic powers, and all have pledged that they will not carry out any nuclear testing. As well as this, Kinkel continued, the preconditions for the acceptance of the agreement on chemical weapons, which will lead to such weapons being forbidden on an international scale, have already been met.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government has said that it believes that the construction industry is still in an economically very weak position; the recession in the industry is not expected to end until 1998 at the earliest. The cabinet has decided to bring in a range of measures intended to improve the economic situation in the industry. Improvements are to be made in the inspection of building sites and German firms are to be considered preferentially in the awarding of government contracts. The government thinks that the social partners involved in collective bargaining must accept some change, and that an agreement must be reached quickly on the question of winter pay (for times when no work can be carried out). The government has rejected a reintroduction of 'bad-weather-money', which was paid when the weather stopped building work, and an extension of other supplementary payments was also rejected.  </field>

<field name="text">The Allianz insurance company has agreed to pay any possible claims by victims of the Nazis without the need for great formalities. Rupprecht, the president of the company, announced today in Stuttgart that the company will try everything to clear up all the events in this regard. In cases where there is some doubt, the credibility of the claimant will suffice and no proof will be needed from the insurance police. Survivors of the Nazi persecution of the Jews and heirs of the victims in the USA are suing seven European insurance companies for millions of dollars; they accuse the companies of not paying out on policies of victims of the Nazis after the war.  </field>

<field name="text">The public prosecutor has called for Monika Boettcher, 38, to be reconvicted in the retrial of her case at the Regional Court in Giessen.

<field name="text">One day before the pronouncement of judgement in the 'Mykonos' trail in Berlin, the Iranian foreign minister, Welajati (sp?), has given his assurance that Germans living in Iran are perfectly safe. He told the press in Teheran that, whatever the judgement might be, the property and personal safety of German citizens is not in danger.

The judgement of the Berlin Regional Court is awaited with suspense around the world. While summing up, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office accused the Iranian government of having commissioned the killing of the four Iranian dissidents in Berlin.  </field>

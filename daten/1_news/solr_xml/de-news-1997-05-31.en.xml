<field name="text">According to the Minister President of Schleswig-Holstein, a reevaluation of the gold-and foreign currency-reserves at this time would undermine trust in the Euro.  She told the DEUTSCHLANDFUNK on Saturday morning that the average citizen's attitude towards the projected European monetary reform was already extremely tense. One could see, she continued, that last resorts were to be applied at this time because of the dramatic budget situation.  Ms. Simonis expressed her opposition to postponing the monetary union.  Of course, she stated it had been the government's mistake  to explain all the necessary attempts at savings by pointing to the Euro. Minister for Finance Waigel had affirmed previously that he wanted it came from his own ranks.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Minister for Finance must be prepared for new vexations if the information given by BILD AM SONNTAG is accurate.  During consultations about the 1998 budget, Waigel supposedly intends to postpone the lowering of the solidarity contribution.  If this is the case, the Minister can count on violent opposition from the FDP.  On Sunday evening, the heads of the Bonn Coalition will meet at the Chancellor's office.  And at this meeting, according to reports by BILD AM SONNTAG, Minister for Finance Waigel wants to propose a two-sided program for consolidation. From the specific details, the paper proposes to make inroads in child payments as well as cuts in the subsidies for coal and agriculture.  To be sure, Mr.  Waigel is said to realize that he can hardly expect to implement these plans.  For this reason, the newspaper states, the Minister for Finance will propose either raising the mineral oil tax or postponing the lowering of the solidarity surtax.  The Free Democrats react by openly threatening to end the Coalition.  Mr. Fridhoff, the economic policy spokesman for the FDP-faction said that he saw no chance that the Liberals would agree to an increase in taxes in order to plug up the holes in the budget. That, he added, also included the solidarity surtax,  </field>

<field name="text">On Saturday, the Coalition of CDU and SPD discussed the controversy surrounding Parliamentary President Hase. The reason for the differences is that the Social Democrats agree with a proposal of the Coalition Greens which had demanded the resignation of the CDU- politician.  Mr. Hase is charged with wrongdoing in political and private matters,  But the vote of Parliament has no binding effect on him since the president is not voted out of office but can only offer his voluntary resignation.  In the meantime, Mr. Hase has rejected such a move.  </field>

<field name="text">Nearly 700 people demonstrated peacefully today against right extremism in Luebeck. A contemporaneous gathering of right oriented groups, along with a feared accompanying confrontation, did not occur. These groups' demonstrations had been prohibited beforehand. The right groups did not reach the seven towers of Luebeck. Security forces arrived early this morning in great number. Several hundred were deployed in front of thecity gates. According to police spokesman Bernd Tegebauer, there were no rightists in sight. With widespread communications, both public and private, throughout the entire land, the police had the situation in hand and had no problems enforcing the legally binding ban on the radical right groups. Several hundred people were in the inner city, following the call of the federation against racism. They protested peacefully against Nazi marches, against ignorance and against arson, as well as demonstrating for an extended right of residence for refugees. After the demonstration there were four preplanned arrests. Whether the Republikaner met, and if so where, is not known. Their planned gathering at a guest house in the Moisling section of town did not take place because the office for public order closed the bar. The reasoning was that an unavoidable threat to guests at the inn must be reckoned with. The churches in Luebeck have called for a silent march this evening.  </field>

In one of the richest countries in the world, there is something wrong with that fact, Krueger said. The SPD Bundestag representitive argued that children's politics should be understood as investment politics.

<field name="text">The president of the German Doctors' Federation, Villmar, has emphatically recommended a no smoking law. In honor of the international No Smoking Day Villmar said that smoking in all public buildings and in the workplace must be banned. Three million die each year worldwide as a result of smoking, and this tendency is rising. The World Health Organization calculates that in the year 2020 there will be ten million smokers' deaths, 70 percent of which will occur in the third world, where the unhealthier aspects of industrial life are gaining acceptance. In this respect smoking is a plague for the WHO, and must be fought with all possible means. It has declared the tobacco industry as its chief opponent. In their pursuit of profit, the industry has suppressed information about the injurious nature of tobacco smoke for decades. The have knowingly driven people into sickness, addiction and death, says the WHO. The basic assumption today is that smoking is the cause of about 25 illnesses. For this reason the organization is calling on all governments finally to act. Tobacco taxes should be so drastically raised that youth can no longer afford cigarettes. Tobacco ads should be so regualted that they are no longer attractive to children. Governments should also develop programs for preventive programs and subsidize smoke ending programs. The total price of all of these programs would be less costly for society than paying for the handling of lung cancer patients.  </field></doc></add>

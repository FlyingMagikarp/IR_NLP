<field name="text">Heavy snowfall and icy roads snarled traffic yesterday evening and last night on the highway between Hannover and Berlin. Traffic came to a complete halt between Peine and Madgeburg. Even snowplows and deicing trucks were stuck. Thousands of drivers were stuck for hours in a 70 km-long traffic jam.The police, Red Cross and a technical assistance agency handed out food, beverages and blankets. Snow and ice created difficult driving conditions in Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern as well.  The situation did not improve until morning when the technical assistance agency towed some abandoned trucks away. Despite these efforts, however, the police still reported a 33 km-long traffic jam into Berlin early this morning.  </field>

<field name="text">After the discussions with the union for metal, engineering and electronics at the federal level and in the southwest, the pilot negotiations in North Rhine-Westphalia were broken off early this morning as well. After 19 hours of discussion, the wage negotiating parties were unable to reach a compromise on sick pay. Mr. Schartau, chief negotiator for the union, claimed that this was the union s last attempt to resolve the conflict as a comprehensive package. He said that strikes may take place beginning at the end of January. Schartau blamed the failure of the talks on the umbrella organization for the employers  association for the steel and engineering industry and its leader, Mr. Stumpfe. He claims that the employers  association destroyed the solution that had been reached. According to Schartau, the top wage negotiators for the union and the employers had virtually reached agreement on a compromise package. With this compromise, sick employees would continue to receive 100% of their salary, but the Christmas bonus   currently at 60% -- would be between 50 and 65 percent in the future and depend on the number of ill employees. The more employees that are off sick in a company, the smaller the Christmas bonus, and vice versa. Salary and wages would also increase by 1.5% in 1997 and by 2.5% in 1998. The employers rejected the package deal after internal discussions among their boards, however. Mr. Kannegiesser, top negotiator for the employers, stated that the model was not elaborate enough and contained too many unreasonable demands.  </field>

<field name="text">After the failed wage negotiations in North Rhine-Westphalia, the union for metal, engineering and electronics no longer wants to try to reach a pilot agreement with employers. Mr. Zwickel, head of the union, announced a tougher stance. He described the failed talks as the last attempt to peacefully resolve the dispute over sick pay. The employers wasted this chance; the union had made considerable compromises in the employers  favor. Mr. Riester, vice president of the union, stated they will now begin 1997 wage negotiations as planned, but that they will be especially tough. The union is preparing for a strike in Bavaria for full sick pay. The non-strike period ends in Bavaria on February 28th. Beginning the first of March, the union has a free hand, according to a spokesperson.  </field>

<field name="text">Starting today, the Bundestag will debate the 1997 budget draft for four days. The budget, disputed between the coalition and opposition parties, will be approved once and for all on Friday. The draft calls for expenditures of approx. DM 440 billion, which is 2.5% less than this year. The net deficit will decrease to DM 53.3 billion, over DM 3 billion less than originally planned by Finance Minister Mr. Waigel. The most extensive changes in expenditures include the Federal Labor Office and the pension insurance carriers. The federal government also plans to realize the greatest savings in social programs. The opposition parties reject the budget, because, they claim, it contains too many risks. They criticize the budget draft as being "chaotic" and "socially unjust". The SPD and the Greens accused the federal government in the final debate of making serious mistakes in financial policy. The speakers for budget policy for the SPD and Greens, Diller and Metzger, stated that unemployment can not be prevented by reducing benefits to the down-and-out and cutting taxes for the higher wage earners. By reducing sick pay, the federal government has set up a confrontation, they said. Diller called the "employment package" a failure of the first order. Under Chancellor Kohl, he claimed, Germany has sacrificed their ability to remain strong in the future.  </field>

<field name="text">Police have launched a large-scale raid against Asian computer rings. In ten countries, 2,000 officials searched about 400 offices and apartments, 11 suspects were arrested, and the search continues for 13 more. In Germany most of the raids took place in the south and in North Rhine-Westphalia. The suspects are claimed to have smuggled substandard computer components into Europe and then sold them as top quality products. One of the leaders was a 36-year old Laotian from Stamberg. A few months ago he was discovered to be involved in dubious financial transactions which were reported to the authorities as suspected money laundering. Damages are estimated to be in the hundreds of million DM. Investigators also believe that the criminal organization was also engaged in money laundering.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government wants to further reorganize social programs, reported State Financial Secretary Ms. Karwazki at the opening of the 4-day final debate in the Bundestag on the 1997 budget. The time has come to continue restructuring the expenditures for social programs. Ms. Karwazki, a CDU member, called for the SPD to stop obstructing the federal government s budget cuts. At DM 154 billion, more than one-third of federal expenditures go to social programs. Diller, SPD spokesman for budgetary policy, accused the federal government of incompetence. The budget drafts are a patchwork: they glorified the economic figures, hid the risks, and denied budget gaps as long as possible.  </field>

<field name="text">The coalition parties are counting on the SPD to approve the annual tax law. Mr. Kloos, head of the CSU members of parliament, reported that the majority of German states recognizes that significant cuts would have to occur if the law were to fail. For instance, the states would not receive DM 4 to 5 billion in income from inheritance tax. The annual tax law is currently under mediation because the Bundesrat rejected the regulation with the majority of SPD-controlled states. According to one local newspaper, the Flensburger Tagblatt, the coalition parties and the SPD have agreed on an increase in the realty transfer tax from 2 to 3.5% beginning in January.  </field>

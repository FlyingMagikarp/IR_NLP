<field name="text">Diplomatic attempts to solve the Kosovo crisis made no progress. Talks between Russian mediator Tchernomyrdin, Finland's President Artisari and US Deputy Foreign Minister Talbot finished without concrete results. The talks are to resume next Wednesday. According to Mr Artisari the key to solving the problems was in Belgrade. Endeavours would be bundled and they would try and find convincing arguments to persuade Belgrade. Mr Talbot called the talks serious and constructive. Victor Tchernomyrdin is expected to travel to the Yugoslavian capital once again at the beginning of next week.  </field>

<field name="text">Today the Upper House (Bundesrat) discussed the contentious law on the 630-marks jobs (also called McJobs). North-Rhine/Westphalia Premier Clement was for it. The SPD-politician said the law was necessary to fight a host of jobs that were exempt from social security contributions. "This isn't, and I want to say it again, about newspaper delivery people or people doing work for sports clubs. That's items we've acknowledged, and they'll be fixed. It's about the fact that up to 13% of jobs in our country are 630-marks jobs - without social security, up to 20% in retail and up to 80% in the office cleaning sector.  </field>

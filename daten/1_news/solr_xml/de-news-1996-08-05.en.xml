<field name="text">The possible transferability of the cattle disease BSE from the cow to the calf was the subject of an emergency meeting in Bonn. Experts followed the invitation by the minister of agriculture, Borchert, and the minister of health, Seehofer, to analyze the latest findings about the disease and discuss items that are still open, e.g. how far the pedigrees of German cows have to be traced back to completely rule out a BSE risk. This question came up after British scientists found out that the BSE agent can very well be transferred from the cow to the calf. Risk: 10 percent. So far, the only possible way of transfer was supposed to be the feeding with BSE contaminated animal feed. Since this theory can no longer be upheld, it is possible that animals which were not born on the island, but have British "ancestors" could develop the disease years later. Some people in charge therefore do no longer rule out the possibility that the BSE virus is being transferred with the milk. A theory which German scientists neither consider to be proven, nor do they think it impossible. A corresponding series of tests is currently being conducted in Great Britain. The agricultural minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hoehn, advocated an extension of the beef export ban to milk products from Great Britain as a result of the new findings. Ms. Hoehn told Deutschlandfunk radio this morning that an intensification of the embargo should be considered as long as it is not clear whether the disease is transferred from the cow to the calf with the mother's milk. The politician of the Greens emphasized that it was a mistake to relax the embargo following the pressure of the British government because it could not be ruled out that semen is a possible carrier of the disease.  </field>

<field name="text">The national union of civil servants (DBB) warned against scaremongering and a jump to conclusions in the dispute over a possible drastic increase of the pensions for civil servants. DBB leader Geier, talked about a campaign against the public services. The reason for the current discussions are the latest calculations by the school of administration in Speyer, according to which the annual cost for the pensions of public servants on the federal level alone will double from 10 to 20 billion DM within the next three decades.  </field>

<field name="text">Several hundred people demonstrated at the train station of Dannenberg against a test run for another Castor transport. According to the citizens' action committee "Umweltschutz (environmental protection) Luechow-Dannenberg" it was planned to test the use of a new container for the transportation of nuclear waste to the intermediate nuclear storage facility in Gorleben. A test run that was planned for last week had to be cancelled, apparently because the Police had not enough manpower due to the "chaos days" in Hanover.  </field>

<field name="text">The first six months of this year show a considerable decrease in violent acts with extreme right or left background in Bavaria. That is the result of a semi-annual report by the Bavarian Department for the tutelage of the constitution which was released by the minister of the interior, Beckstein, today. An organized neo-nazi scene is almost nonexistent, according to the estimate by Beckstein, but there is a risk of right-wingers forming up again. The largest decrease could be seen in violent acts committed by extreme right-wingers. Only 13 acts of violence have been registered in the first 6 months of 1996. That is 50% less than last year, but one extreme-right organization, "Skinheads Allgaeu", has been banned already despite its disguise as a society for the maintenance of Skinhead culture. "Two-thirds of its members have been involved in criminal investigations, some of them several times. The glorification of National Socialism, the use of NS symbols, NS slogans, and hatred against foreigners were essential parts of this Skinhead scene," Beckstein said. The party "The Republicans" remains anti-constitutional according to the opinion of the Bavarian ministry of the interior. The same applies to the extreme left-wing party PDS. Autonomous left-wing groups which are willing to use violence are infiltrating the anti-nuclear movement. The decrease of violence by foreign extremists should not be misleading. The Kurdish PKK is still willing to use violence, said Beckstein.  </field>

<field name="text">A judgment was pronounced today in the so-called "girl murder trial", which lasted for two month. The jury court in Munich had to determine whether the 36-year old defendant, Mario Abend, killed an 18-year old student following an attempted rape. According to the prosecutor, Walter Weidman, there could only be one sentence for the murder of the girl and the rape of three other women: life imprisonment in connection with preventive detention. That would mean that Mario Abend would be released after 25 years at the earliest. The defense pleaded for manslaughter and a limited sentence. The prosecution is convinced that Abend tried to rape the student during the night of January 8, 1995. The girl fought back, so Abend hit and finally strangled her. He then brought the corpse into his apartment and threw her in a garbage container the following day. The fact that workers in a waste treatment plant found the dead body made it possible to solve the case of the missing Stefanie K. and that Abend could be put on trial. The defense denied the low motives for Abend's actions and called them pure speculations. Last week, the prosecution had accused a psychology expert appointed by the defense of manipulations in favor of the defendant. The psychologist was challenged for bias by the court and is facing a judicial inquiry. The court sentenced Abend according to the prosecution's motion. In his statement, the leading judge Juergen Hahnrich described Abend as a person with a tendency to violent acts and sexual offenses. He carefully selected his victims and attacked women who could not be dangerous for him as witnesses.  </field>

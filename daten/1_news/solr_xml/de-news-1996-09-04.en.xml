<field name="text">According to the Social Democrats, there is an 18-billion-mark budget gap in the draft budget for 1997. Budget expert of the SPD parliamentary faction Diller called Finance Minister Waigel's draft "cobbled together and unrealistic", and called on Waigel to come up with amendments. Otherwise, Diller said, there was a real threat of an unconstitutionally high level of new debt and of placing the European monetary union in jeopardy.  </field>

<field name="text">German President Herzog and Czech President Havel today visited a youth meeting in East Bohemia. The four-day meeting of 250 adolescents from both countries is designed to further understanding and to combat prejudices. Herzog called on the youth of both nations to not let guilt and suffering of the past stand in the way of a more humane future, but rather to do better where previous generations had failed. The President challenged the young adults to face history "with the courage to tackle the whole truth". Herzog advised patience in the issue of the desired joint declaration on reconciliation between the two countries. He joined Havel in stressing that the highest level of diligence was called for in view of the difficulty of the problems at hand, and that a few weeks more or less ought not to matter in this case. Havel expressed his hope that a declaration would be signed in the near future despite the differences of opinion.  </field>

<field name="text">Bonn and Brussels have agreed on a compromise in the row over the 91-million-mark subsidy paid to Volkswagen by Saxony without permission by the Commission of the EU. The compromise binds Bonn to the undertaking to freeze a proportionate amount of funds earmarked for VW. EU Commissioner Van Wiert said that as the car manufacturer was thus not receiving more money overall, the Commission would refrain from applying for an injunction. THe compromise meant that there was now some time in which a legally acceptable solution could be found, Van Wiert added. Economics Minister Rexrodt said he welcomed the decision by the EU Commission. Speaking in Bonn today, he said the dropping of the injunction threat afforded time for a rational solution to be found. He added that he was hopeful that a positive result in the negotiations would render the Commission's planned suit against the Federal Government superfluous.  </field>

<field name="text">The row over the party's direction in the ranks of the Alliance 90/Greens continues, with Baden-Wuerttemberg State Parliamentary Faction leader Kuhn publicly criticising Federal Board Executive Spokesman Trittin. In an interview with the weekly newspaper "Die Woche", Kuhn said a coalition offer to the PDS was wrong. If the Greens decided to follow this path proposed by Trittin, they had already lost, he continued, because in that case the debate during an election campaign was not going to be over Green reform poltics but over the PDS. On the contrary, Kuhn argued in favour of seeking and offering manifold alliances within the middle-ground of society.  </field>

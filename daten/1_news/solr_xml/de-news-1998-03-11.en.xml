<field name="text">Leading representatives of the unions and business associations have met with Federal Labour Minister Bluem to discuss federal employment policies. The meeting was held to develop an action plan on unemployment, which the federal government had committed itself to at an EU employment summit meeting last November. Bonn has turned its attention specifically to youth unemployment and to the re-integration of those who have been out of the labour market for long periods. The government does not plan to release any new monies into its employment programs, according to vice-chairman of the German Federation of Unions, Engelen-Kefer. Bluem does, however, want to extend the government's program benefitting the long-term unemployed.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl has warned against a drastic increase in the cost of gasoline, saying that a price of 5 DM/litre, as the Greens are calling for, would put jobs and investments at risk. Kohl was speaking at the celebratory opening of the new headquarters of auto manufacturer Opel in Ruesselsheim, Hesse. At the same time, Kohl called for continued reductions in noise and air pollution from autos. Opel's chairman of the board, Hermann, said that he stood behind Standort Deutschland (Germany as a base for economic activity), and pointed out that the company had spent over DM 4 billion just on the development of its new model, the Astra. He added that Opel was planning further investments.  </field>

<field name="text">Arbitration has begun in the contract dispute in the public sector. The member of the arbitration team for the employees, an SPD politician, Koschnik, plans to table a suggested settlement in five days. He judged the overall situation as being difficult, saying "The ice is pretty thin, and the cow is pretty fat." Following the first round of negotiations, the arbitrators expressed cautious optimism. Koschnik said the talks showed there was a possibility of success, although "the devil hides in the details". He added that both sides agreed on the principle of a consensual solution, and wanted to avoid a strike. The other arbitrator, former Rhineland-Palatinate Premier Wagner, said the plan was to try to put together a package deal acceptable to both sides. He also said that the sticking points seemed to be employment security , sick pay continuance, and the issue of extra old age security. The arbitration talks resume on Monday.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Internal Affairs Minister Kanther has reiterated his assessment that there is presently no reason to implement a general halt on deportations of Albanians from the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo. Speaking on Deutschlandfunk radio, Kanther suggested especially that such a move could send a signal that would induce many others to go to Germany, hoping to then remain in the country. The minister also accused several of the German states with SPD-led governments of abdicating the joint responsibility for deporting foreigners. Kanther emphasized Albanians from Kosovo would not be deported if their lives were threatened.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government is expecting economic growth of between 2.5 and 3 percent for the current year. The information comes from the 1998 Economic Report which was passed by the cabinet today. Federal Economic Minister Rexrodt told journalists in Bonn that the number of unemployed was going to sink for the first time in four years and, in December, would be about 200,000 less than at the end of 1997. The SPD and Alliance/Greens said it was unclear where the upturn was supposed to come from, and that the predicted growth was insufficient to create new jobs.  </field>

<field name="text">According to a study by the German Central Bank, prices are increasing significantly more slowly than official statistics indicate. The Central Bank's Economic Research Group in Frankfurt explained that the monthly cost-of-living index may over-estimate the actual inflation rate by more than 3/4 of a percent. According to the group , the largest source of error was that the Federal Statistics Office failed to take into full account changes in quality or the introduction of new models of products; also changes in consumer behaviour were not calculated in quickly enough. According to the Bank's reasoning, inflation in Germany is approaching zero.  </field>

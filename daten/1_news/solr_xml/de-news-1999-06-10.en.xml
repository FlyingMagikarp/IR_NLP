<field name="text">The UN Security Council passed the long disputed Kosovo resolution. China was the only member who abstained. The paper is a pre-requisite for the actions of peace keeping force in Kosovo which is supposed to consist of 50,000 soldiers. The federal government and the Bundestag in Bonn postponed the final decision regarding an increase of the German NATO-contigent for the Kosovo peace troops until tomorrow. Germany wants to participate with up to 8,500 soldiers. Prior to any advances of the Bundeswehr soldiers, however, the Bundestag will have to agree to it at tomorrow's special meeting. Together with British troops, the first Bundeswehr units are to advance into the province of Kosovo via Macedonia on Saturday.  Also, Germans, jointly with Dutch soldiers, are to control the southwesternmost corner of Kosovo.  </field>

<field name="text">With a large majority, the executive of the CDU has approved of Employment Minister Bluem's concept for reforming the pension system. Only two of the leading politicians in the party objected to the suggested plan. Bluem's model has pension levels sink to 64 percent of net earnings. Saxony's Premier Biedenkopf, however, wanted a minimum pension level to be established, financed through tax revenues. A final decision will be made at a CDU party convention on Wednesday of next week. Following approval there, coalition partner FDP will also have to approve the plan.  </field>

<field name="text">During an evacuation operation in Tirana, A German Bundeswehr helicopter was shot at by Albanians from the back of a truck. According to a report on Turkish television, German soldiers returned the fire. The German Foreign Office says that the evacuation of the 110 Germans and other foreign nationals was successfully completed. Federal Foreign Minister Kinkel told the press in Bonn: "Since yesterday, the situation in Albania is this: there is practically anarchy all over the country; there is no control in the hands of police forces, ministries, or the administration; there is a totally confused security situation which changes hourly; there is gunplay in many areas; the international airport Rinas (sp?) in Tirana is closed; the quick evacuation of the foreigners wanting to leave became essential. Federal Defence Minster Ruehe explained the course of the evacuation: "Originally we wanted to land at the American embassy; I believe we were already en route; then American helicopters also came under rocket-fire and the Americans broke off the evacuation, so that we very quickly had to decide on another spot to land, which we had our security forces secure, and then carried out the operation. If the fact that our helicopters had been deployed, and if the landing place had been known, the safety of our soldiers would have been seriously put at risk. Meanwhile, a mediator for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Vranitzky, is pushing for a military intervention in Albania. Vranitzky said, after a meeting with the new Albanian government leader Fino (sp?) on board an Italian warship, that the European Union must seriously consider sending in a multinational force. The Albanian state press agency ATA has reported that at least 100 people have been killed so far in the unrest.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bundesrat completed a full agenda today. The states' representatives approved the new vehicle tax that recently passed through the Bundestag. The Bundesrat also passed the law requiring visas for foreign children in Germany. Additionally, a decision was made about bad weather allowances: the Bundesrat is in favour of its reintroduction, finding that its abolishment did not achieve anything in the end, but rather cost more than a billion Marks.  </field>

<field name="text">The new store hours have slowed the loss of full-time jobs in the retail sector and caused more part-time work to be available. The number of those employed in retail work rose by 1.2 percent last November and again by 0.1 percent in December. The Federal Statistics Office concludes that the new extended store hours are responsible for the increases. It has been almost exclusively part-time jobs that have been created, but at least the wave of lay-offs of full-time employees has been stopped. The Union for Trade, Banking, and Insurance, however, believes many of the short-term contracts signed to be only for "610-Mark jobs" and that they were only for the busy Christmas season. The retail employers' association disagrees. Fifteen percent of stores are employing more people than before, very few of those in the lowest-paying category. A study by the Society for Consumer Research has also found that the extended store hours are worth it, financially: retail sales are up 0.4 percent. The researchers' conclusion: if people have more time to shop, they will also spend more.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Finance Minister Waigel wants to resume talks with the SPD about tax reform as quickly as possible. Waigel presented a new draft of the tax reforms: the gap in the federal treasury would, according to Waigel's estimates, be smaller than was feared, at 8 billion Marks. He wants to cover that amount by increasing indirect taxes. The minister did not specify whether that means he is thinking of the value-added tax or, as the SPD is demanding, the oil tax. The tax reform bill is to be presented to the Bundestag on October 9, and to the Bundesrat in November, so the reforms could still become law this year. Waigel called on the SPD to resume the talks, which they had broken off, immediately. "As far as I am concerned," he said, "we could resume the talks as early as this afternoon."  </field>

<field name="text">Finance Minister Mayer-Vorfelder (sp?) wants to provisionally finance budgetary shortfalls due to federal tax reforms by means of limited-time credit. Baden-Wurttemberg is facing a budget gap of 2 to 3 billion Marks, he says, and further cuts cannot make up for a shortfall on that scale. The state SPD has criticized the suggestion. Their financial spokesman, Herbert Moser, said that Mayer-Vorfelder is looking at the most expensive of the possible courses of action. The term "provisional financing" is intended to obscure his plan to acquire new debt, they charge. Mayer-Vorfelder had previously explained that the line of credit he is suggesting would not represent new debt.  </field>

<field name="text">Criticism of the Baden-Wurttemberg FDP's application to change the state's drug policies continues to come from the ranks of the CDU. At the center of the dispute stands Economic Minister and FDP leader, Walter Doering, who is behind the move. The state spokesman for the CDU on drug-related matters, Ingrid Blank, has said there will be no movement on the major points. Major points are, especially, Doering's calls for drug houses and the controlled distribution of heroin to those worst addicted. Such demands go beyond the coalition agreement between the CDU and the FDP. Even in Erwin Vetter's Social Ministry there is amazement over Doering's suggestions. The Social Minster will not change his position, a spokesman said. The CDU's youth organization, the Young Union, in northern Wurttemberg, says, however, that it can imagine distributing heroin to the worst addicts under certain circumstances. On the other hand, the CDU's federal spokesman on drug-related issues, Roland Sauer, calls the position of the state FDP a capitulation vis-a-vis the drug problem. Sauer is advocating the so-called Swedish model, in which drug addicts can be forced into therapy for their addiction.  </field>

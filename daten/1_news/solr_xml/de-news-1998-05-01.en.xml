<field name="text">As expected, the European Union's finance ministers nominated 11 countries for membership in the European Currency Union. At this first stage, the current EU-members will be in; however, Greece, Denmark, Great Britain and Sweden will stay out for the time being. They also agreed to an additional pledge concerning the euro's stability, required by Germany. This pledge was about running a tight ship budget-wise and paying off public debt, as of July 1 of this year, that's half a year before the  start of the currency union.  Heads of state and government will make the final decision tomorrow, at the summit meeting proper, and that's also when they will decide on who will head the European Central Bank.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the unions, approximately  500,000 people took part in rallies for the May 1 holiday (Labour Day). Head of the unions (DGB) Schulte asked for a change of direction in Germany while taking part in a demonstration in Munich. Germany would now need an effective and active employment policy. Elsewhere union bosses accused government of being responsible for new record-highs in unemployment. They also refuted claims that they were pushing certain political parties' barrows during the current electioneering.  Previously CDU/CSU and FDP had accused the unions of siding with the SPD.  </field>

<field name="text">Today there were severe clashes during a demonstration by the right-wing extremist party NPD at the monument commemorating the battle of Leipzig (Voelkerschlachtsdenkmal). While the predominantly younger NPD followers got themselves organised, left-wing protesters, some wearing face-masks, attacked more than 6,000 police with rocks, bottles, iron balls and firecrackers. Police retaliated with truncheons and water-cannons. Eight police and an unknown number of protesters were injured, some severely. Several dozen people were detained. Some NPD-members, trying to improvise a parade without having obtained a permit previously, got into fights with police. Police, however, were able to keep left- and right-wingers from fighting each other.  </field>

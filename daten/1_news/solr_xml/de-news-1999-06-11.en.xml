<field name="text">A big majority of the members of parliament (Bundestag) voted for the deployment of another 8500 armed forces, to be part of the international peace-corps KFOR. 505 were for the proposal, 24 against and 11 abstained. Almost all speakers acknowledged the endeavours to end the war and congratulated federal government to its success in the matter. As early as this Friday, a first contingent of some 2000 German KFOR soldiers will be deployed from Macedonia, and will probably reach the Kosovo region on Saturday, together with British armed forces.  </field>

<field name="text">Defence Minister Scharping called the deployment of German armed forces as part of the Kosovo peace-corps "extremely risky". They would be threatened by landmines, booby-traps and attacks by "political pirates". It was irrelevant if the latter were Serbs or part of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Mr Scharping emphasised that the soldiers' safety had absolute priority. He would not be drawn on how long KFOR was planning to stay, but if the past example of Bosnia was anything to go by, this could take several years. The additional cost could be billions of marks.  </field>

<field name="text">The repatriation of the Kosovo refugees currently in Germany is not expected to begin before next spring. According to Federal Minister for Internal Affairs Schily, all must return, though not head over heels. Chancellor Schroeder said that the Kosovo region would get comprehensive aid to rebuild, though that was conditional on a speedy democratisation process in Belgrade. As early as this Sunday, the first UN-convoy carrying food, blankets and plastic tarpaulins for needy Kosovars will arrive in the region.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder backed the ideas he had formulated together with British premier Blair, namely about modernising European social democracy. When interviewed on TV ARD, Mr Schroeder declared that Mr Blair and he had been driven by the requirement to face a global economy. He wanted to avoid isolating the German SPD party as far as their ideology went. Mr Schroeder will come back on this issue again on Wednesday, just before the G8-summit meeting. The FDP party wants to put his ideas to a vote by name, in parliament (Bundestag).  </field>

The Upper House (Bundesrat) passed the draft on to a select committee. The unions were against the move.  </field>

<field name="text">After eggs tested for PCBs in the state of Hesse came up with positive results, the tests are to be extended to all of Germany, where currently eggs are being tested for dioxin. The Producers Association asked for labelling of eggs to show their country of origin. So far 14,000 farms in Belgium had been using dioxin-contaminated chicken-feed. Certificates of compliance should clear the way for exporting Belgian meat products, according to a decision by the EU Veterinary Commission  </field></doc></add>

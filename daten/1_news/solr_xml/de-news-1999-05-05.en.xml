<field name="text">US President Bill Clinton met the three American soldiers newly released by Belgrade, at the US Air Force support base at Ramstein, Germany this afternoon. He was also briefed on the aid shipments being sent into the Balkans from the base. Earlier, he spoke to soldiers at Spangdalem, the starting point of American stealth bombers on sorties against Yugoslavia. Clinton thanked the soldiers for their efforts. He announced that the air attacks on Yugoslavia would be widened, and would continue as long as Kosovars were still being driven from their homes, saying that steadfast opposition must be offered against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign of destruction. Clinton said there could be no peace without an international force, with NATO at its center, guaranteeing a return of the Kosovars driven from their homes.  </field>

<field name="text">Bill Clinton will visit the facilities in Ingelheim tomorrow which the German government has made available for evacuated Kosovar refugees. Around 1100 officers will ensure the American president's safety in Ingelheim. The landing of his helicopter at a nearby soccer stadium has been rehearsed, as has the 800-metre drive from the stadium to the refugee housing. Clinton's arrival in Ingelheim is scheduled for 11:15 tomorrow morning. He will spend about an hour in close conversation with two pre-selected families from Kosovo, to get a first-hand account of conditions in the region. Following that, Clinton will be joined by his Foreign Minister Madeleine Albright, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to view the facility. Clinton will subsequently speak to the assembled refugees before flying out at 2 pm.  </field>

<field name="text">The crisis in Kosovo came to dominate large sections of what was supposed to be a budget debate in the Bundestag today. The opposition parties, with the exception of the PDS, used the open debate period of the Chancellery budget debate to voice their support for the government's policies on Kosovo. CDU/CSU caucus leader Wolfgang Schaeuble said that the CDU/CSU would approve the deployment of further German soldiers to the Balkans. PDS caucus leader Gregor Gysi condemned the NATO attacks as an illegal war of aggression. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer defended the alliance's engagement. Schroeder said that the military action was necessary in order to reach a political solution. Fischer refuted fears that the additional German soldiers, up to 1000 of them, could become involved in a ground war; he said their only duty would be to help the refugees in the camps.  </field>

<field name="text">With eight days until the Greens' special party conference to discuss the Kosovo conflict, a pacifist wing of the party has formed to oppose Federal Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. A group of northern German Greens today proposed a motion to end the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia immediately. If a majority of participants at the convention in Bielefeld on Ascension Day (May 13) vote in favour of the motion, then Fischer will have lost the backing of his party for his policies on Kosovo.  </field>

<field name="text">During today's budget debate, the Opposition accused the Government of failure in its approach to the so-called 630-DM jobs, saying it had achieved the opposite of what it had intended. During the Internal Affairs portion of the budget debate, spokesmen for the CDU/CSU and the FDP called upon the government to reverse its changes to the laws governing the 630-DM jobs and nominally independent contract-work. Chancellor Schroeder replied that his government was correcting the mistakes of its predecessor.  </field>

<field name="text">According to Federal Internal Affairs Minister Otto Schily, it should be made easier for all levels of government to dismiss employees in the future. Schily told the weekly newspaper "Die Zeit" that he saw it as a mistaken development that it was often practically impossible to dismiss public service officials. He said that he had the impression, from talks with the public service union OeTV, that the labour body was prepared to consider reform proposals.  </field>

<field name="text">After the loss of his musical production company, Stella, the rest of Stuttgart entrepreneur Rolf Deile's empire is now also in pieces. According to a newspaper report, Deile's real estate company Instag AG is being dissolved, along with numerous subsidiary holdings. Some of Deile's large projects, such as a planned solar-powered housing complex in Freiburg had already been halted, according to the report, because creditors refused to grant Deile, already heavily in debt, any further credit.  </field></doc></add>

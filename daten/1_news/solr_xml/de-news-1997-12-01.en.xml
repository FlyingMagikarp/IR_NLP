<field name="text">The federal government will take action regarding the billing scandals concerning lab physicians and heart specialists. Minister of Health Seehofer told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper that he would develop procedures in collaboration with physicians and health insurance companies in order to make manipulations more difficult. This also includes budget checks. Seehofer stated that it was not possible simply to return to daily routine, given the current increase in the number of investigations and trials concerning billing violations. He said that he continued to believe that the majority of physicians is acting correctly.  </field>

<field name="text">IG Metall union leader Zwickel continues to assume an increase in the unemployment rate during the winter to 5 million. Zwickel said in an interview with Leipziger Volkszeitung that he had appealed to the coalition several months ago to change its course. In light of this, he also criticized the employers and added that they had not contributed anything toward a solution of this crisis except for empty promises. At the same time he announced that the unions would enter the Bundestag election campaign with a campaign for work and social justice. Zwickel stressed that it was time for Germany to have a government which would advance innovations, promote investments, and create new jobs.  </field>

<field name="text">The Day of Prayer and Repentance will remain a work day in Holstein. In yesterday's referendum, only 20% of more than 2 million registered voters were in favor of re-introducing the Day of Prayer and Repentance as a legal holiday. At least 25% would have been necessary in order for the referendum to be successful. The initiative for a referendum originated with the Protestant Church. The CDU faction of the State Parliament in Kiel now wants to become actively involved in this issue.  Like all other states except Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein had abolished the holiday in order to finance the employers' contributions to nursing-care insurance.  </field>

<field name="text">Beginning today, those traveling from Germany to Austria may be able to pass the border without having to show their passport. Austria is a member of the so-called Agreement of Schengen which facilitates border traffic between EU member countries. However, traffic at Austrian and German border checkpoints is not completely without stops yet. Checks are gradually decreased, which will take the longest for the busier border stations. The Schengen era did start today at smaller crossing points to Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. This does not mean that there are no controls at all. Passports are still required documents for travelling citizens of the European Union, although they are not asked to show them at the border. With the help of so-called "undercover investigations" and "right to pursuit across jurisdiction boundaries", there will be spot-checks beyond the border, mainly to fight organised crime. The police is also allowed to operate across the border into the neighboring country.  </field>

<field name="text">At the beginning of a week of student demonstrations, the Education   Science union (GEW) demanded an alliance for education and science. The union also demanded spaces for at least 100,000 new students over the next three years and the hiring of an additional 10,000 teaching assistants and tutors. The union called on federal and state governments to improve university facilities; otherwise it would soon no longer be possible to offer high-quality university education in Germany. The GEW considers the draft for a new federal law on university education nothing but a legal tug-of-war between federal and state governments. The chairpersons of CDU and CSU in federal and state governments defended the university reform. A white paper, written together with Minister of Education Ruettgers, states that only the new law could effectively fight the tension-laden situation at German universities.  The number of universities on strike has increased to 60. Strikes are carried on at all West German universities except for Bremen.  </field>

<field name="text">The State court issued several prison sentences in the trial involving the theft of memory cards at the computer manufacturer Hewlett Packard. The 5 defendants stole more DM 50 milliom from the company. The mastermind behind this theft, who was responsible for the organisation and distribution of the stolen goods, received a 5 1/2-year sentence, and the recipient of the stolen goods, who had written the invoices, received a 2 1/2-year prison sentence. The presiding judge referred to the punishment as relatively mild, saying that the defendants' confessions had had a positive effect. Without them, it would have taken much longer to solve one of the biggest employee thefts in Germany. Yet another positive effect had been the attempt to compensate for the damage. The presiding judge acknowledged that Hewlett Packard was partially to be blamed since the thieves could never have carried off the stolen goods in backpacks if better surveillance had been in place.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the Munich media giant Leo Kirch, the international soccer federation, FIFA, will not be able to cancel the contract on marketing the soccer world cups in 2002 and 2006 on television. In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Kirch's chief executive officer Hahn rejected the threat made by FIFA's General Secretary, Blatter, that the federation  would carry through the free live broadcast for everyone, if necessary by canceling the contract. Hahn stated that a fully valid license agreement did exist. Neither the rights stemming from this license nor the agreed upon purchase price of DM 3.4 billion could be generalized. Blatter, on the other hand, only mentioned a basic contract with Kirch.  </field>

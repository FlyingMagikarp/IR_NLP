<field name="text">About 200 right wing demonstrators, along with about 50 counterdemonstrators, gathered today at the Neumarkt, near the Worms Cathedral. They assembled there for an illegal commemoration of the death of Hitler's lieutenant, Hess. 150 police circled the demonstrators with the assignment of arresting all of them immediately and removing them from Worms. In the course of this action, 160 Neonazis were taken and a great deal of propaganda, baseball bats and chains were seized.  In other cities, there were gatherings of the radical right, and, on those grounds. police arrested nearly 300 Neonazis, 30 from Hessen and 7 from the Upper Franconia section of Bavaria. In Baden-Wuerttemberg 29 Nazi sympathizers were taken into custody, and in the Saarland the Federal border patrol turned roughly 20 rightists back at the German-French border. Most of these radicals were from France or the Netherlands, but there were Germans among them as well. On the occasion of the death of Hitler's deputy Hess, there were 20 applications for demonstration permits in the entire federal Republic. All were denied. In southern Sweden several hundred rightists created a riot among themselves, counterdemonstrators and the police, during which bottles and rocks flew. The Neonazis came from Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Germany. Swedish authorities had authorized the demonstration, but not that of the counterdemonstrators.  </field>

<field name="text">Politicians of the ruling parties are carrying out their debate about tax reform in interviews. Finance Minister Waigel told the Bildzeitung that the reform would not be implemented until 1999. FDP leader Gerhardt informed the paper Welt am Sonntag that his party would enact parts of the reform as early as 1998. Chancellery Office Minister Bohl declared on Radio Free Berlin that the tax reform would be activated no later than January 1, 1999. The dispute is over the details of the plan to lower the salary tax and the income tax and to dismantle tax benefits, while raising the value-added tax. The FDP will only agree to a higher VAT if social benefits are lowered, a move that Finance minister Waigel refused.  </field>

<field name="text">Travelers returning from the North caused a traffic jam on the Hamburg-Flensburg highway. For 100 KM autos were stopped, and those who managed to get beyond that were confronted with a 25 KM long jam at the entrance to the Hamburg Elbe tunnel. The flood of returning travelers was caused by the coinciding end of summer vacation in North Rhine-Westphalia and the Netherlands, as well as the end of factory holidays in several auto firms.  </field></doc></add>

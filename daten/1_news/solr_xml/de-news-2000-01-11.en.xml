<field name="text">CDU president Wolfgang Schaeuble has defended his actions in the party donations affaire. At a press conference in Berlin, Schaeuble said he did not feel responsible in any way. Everything was as it should when he accepted the 100'000-DM-donation of Bavarian arms dealer Karl-Heinz Schreiber. Schaeuble had given the money to CDU treasurer Baumeister. Schaeuble assured that he had not received any donations of the same dimension. Meanwhile, Ms. Baumeister has accepted accountability for illegally booking the donation as "various revenue" instead of "donation". Schaeuble has also come under pressure from his own party today. Several leaders at the CDU state level called his behaviour disappointing. They accused Scaeuble of informing the party and the public much too late. The leaders of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, Juergen Ruettgers and Christoph Boehr, however, called Schaeuble's behaviour "correct". Meanwhile, arms dealer Schreiber who is living in Canada has stated the actual purpose of his 100'000-DM-donation for the first time. Schreiber told the daily "Die Welt" he wanted to encourage the construction of a Thyssen factory for light tank vehicles in Canada. In his political contacts with CDU but also SPD he was lobbying for the project.  </field>

<field name="text">Difficult collective bargaining is expected for the metal and electrical industry. The union IG Metall is demanding pay rises of 5.5 percent. Werner Stumpfe, the president of Gesamtmetall representing the employers said the union wanted to take more from the pot than it contained. It was agreed in the Alliance for Labour that wage contracts would be aimed at the average production growth of the total economy. This, however, was put by experts at 2.6 percent.  The CEO of the Federal Alliance of German Employers Associations Mr. Goehner (sp?) warned IG Metall against disrupt the Alliance for Labour.  </field>

<field name="text">Saxony-Anhalt's Building Minister Juergen Heyer has warned to turn the discussion on empty apartments against street blocks dominated by buildings consisting of pre-fabricated parts. Empty partments were no problem specific to pre fabs, said Heyer today in Magdeburg. At the awards ceremony for exemplary renovations of pre-fab blocks the minister stated that empty flats were always a problem of places with low availability of quality housing. This could happen in historic city centres as well as in unrenovated building from the end of the 19th century or post-war years. Another important cause for empty flats was the population decrease of Saxony-Anhalt and the other East-German states.  </field>

<field name="text">French transport companies have tightened their border blockades today. Freight traffic in Switzerland, to Germany, Spain, Belgium and Italy has been brought to a standstill at 70 border crossings. Foreign truck-drivers are not only being hindered on entry to the country, but often also when leaving. On the French-German border alone fifteen crossing points have been blocked. Private cars, however, are so far still being let through. The transport  companies are protesting against the introduction of the 35-hour work week. They fear competition disadvantages with respect to their European counterparts, whose drivers work longer hours.  </field>

<field name="text">The PDS-state parliament factions from Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern want to collaborate more closely. After a round of talks in Schwerin it appears that in both states policies on the labour market and economy, as well as on budgetary issues and finance, are comparable. Joint actions are also possible on the state parliament level. As faction leader Sitte for the PDS from Saxony-Anhalt emphasized, they plan to follow the example of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern where, since the fall of 1998, they have had the first Red-Red coalition in Germany. In two years time there will be state parliamentary elections in Saxony-Anhalt. Then the PDS must ask itself again whether it will consider joint government with the SPD.  </field>

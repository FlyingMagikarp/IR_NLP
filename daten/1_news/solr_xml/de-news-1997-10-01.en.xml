<field name="text">The heads of the coalition in Bonn met today, at the Chancellor's office surprisingly, to renew their work on how the planned reduction in the solidarity surcharge [an extra 7.5% on income tax] can be financed. Apparently, the FDP wants to present its proposal for financing to counter the reduction in the surcharge.  The FDP's proposal concentrates on further savings and privatization. The Deutsche Presseagentur (German Press Agency) has reported that the proposed introduction of an insurance tax on risk insurance has been rejected, however.  If the solidarity surcharge is reduced from 7.5% to 5.5%, the state treasury would lose an additional DM 7 billion revenue. The FDP have already had to withdraw an announced surcharge reduction once, as the budget deficit could not be corrected.  On account of this, the liberals want to stand firm and not be derailed, this time.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the IG Metall [Union for Metal, Engineering and Electronics], the industry employers today adopted a mediated settlement regarding the "part-time pension" in North Wuerttemberg/North Baden.  None of the directors or the committee were in opposition to the settlement, reported the responsible union chapter in Stuttgart.  The compromise on wages provides for an arrangement to be made in the coming month, regarding the "part-time pension", for those employees of the firms who are over 55 years of age.  After the age of 61, the "part-time pension" becomes a right. This is a precedent setting resolution for the industry in the whole of Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">DGB President Schulte does not think that the unions should force a greatly increased wage in the coming negotiations.  Schulte made his comments, which go against what the IG-Metall President Zwickel has said, to the Koelner Stadtanzeiger newspaper. Zwickel had recommended strong wage demands, because the failure of tax reform has meant that there will be no tax reductions for wage earners.  In contrast, Schulte's opinion is that wage politics should primarily assure the security of employment.  As an example of this, Schulte referred to the adjustment of early retirement/part-time work in the Southwest German metal industry.  </field>

<field name="text">A controversy has arisen in the Bundestag over the controversial freedom from social security for low paid jobs.  In the topical debate moved for by the Social Democrats, SDP representative Ulla Schmidt stressed that the number of so-called "610 DM jobs" is increasing in parallel with the growth of unemployment.  Jobs requiring social security payments  are increasingly being transformed into ones that do not.  CSU representative Ramsauer attributed this to the general high tax-load, a reduction in which the Opposition has hindered.  FDP politician Babel rejected an abolishment of this type of employment as unsocial.  </field>

<field name="text">Turkish Prime Minister Yilmaz is ready to compromise to obtain an EU membership for his country.  After his return from a 2 day visit to Bonn, he spoke before the parliamentary deputies from his party in Ankara, saying he had reached an understanding with Chancellor Kohl. Kohl explained his fear that up to 8 million Turks would come to Germany to seek work as a result of Turkey joining the EU. Yilmaz emphasized that he is therefore ready for Turkey to give up the right of free choice of work and place of residence as a condition of joining the EU.  </field>

<field name="text">Defense minister Ruehe confirmed that the NATO countries, together with Russia are planning to develop a new transport aircraft.  The aircraft will be based on the Antonov military transport, and will take the place of the antiquated Transall aircraft.  In addition to Germany and Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are interested in the project.  It appears the key role will be played by the European Airbus company.  In Germany, around 80 Transall aircraft must be replaced by the armed forces in the next 10 years.  The Russian Antonov is deployed world wide as a transport aircraft, and is valued by pilots for its robustness.  </field>

<field name="text">Health Minister Seehofer stressed that the East German public health insurance funds will need assistance from the West to equalize their deficits.  Savings alone will not make up the difference, Seehofer said, after a meeting with his colleagues from the new federal States as well as with representatives of the funds in Bonn.  A joint workgroup is expected to present a proposed solution by the end of the month.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl asked for a faster better dissemination of research results.  To accomplish this, the potential users of the results should be more closely included in the development process than in the past, said Kohl at a public seminar (part of the "Research Days" at Schiller University in Jena).  The chances for commercial utility should be realized more consistently.  </field>

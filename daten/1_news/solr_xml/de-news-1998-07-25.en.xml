<field name="text">The SPD's designated Minister of Economics, Mr. Stollman, ensured continued controversy with his remarks on social policy.  Mr. Schroeder, the SPD's candidate for chancellor, has rejected union criticism of Stollman..  Only someone that measures things with a micrometer could come up with such a critique, said Schroeder to "Der Spiegel."  Ms. Engelen-Kefer, the acting president of the DGB [the German Federation of Trade Unions], warned Schroeder and Stollman not to terminate the social contract between the SPD and the DGB by streamlining social services.  Mr. Henkel, the president of the Federation of German Industry, told the newspaper "Die Welt" that he didn't believe Stollman could push his ideas through the SPD.  </field>

<field name="text">A year ago, the floodwaters of the Oder reached an all-time high, and today the inhabitants of the Zeltendorf lowlands held a festival to express their gratitude for being saved.  In addition to Chancellor Kohl, thousands of people came from all over Germany who had earlier donated money or lent a hand.  Last year on July 24th, the area was inundated after two dikes broke.  Around 300 houses stood meter-deep under water for approximately 3 weeks.  The mayor of Zeltendorf, Reiner Vierling, recalled those days a year ago when the dikes burst and the lowlands were submerged.  "A year ago, even we had almost given up.  There was water even here where we are standing. Everywhere, there was nothing but a stinking soup out of which peered the tops of houses and trees -- trees that were the last refuge for animals that we still barely notice."  For Chancellor Kohl, the flood showed above all that East and West Germans belong together.  "On this occasion, something I've long been certain of was visible to everyone: We, all Germans, belong together, and we stick together when it counts.  This is a truth deeply rooted in the minds of most Germans."  The Chancellor also said that the lesson of the flood was clear.  We should not simply trust that a flood like this will only come around once every thousand years, he said.  We have to act now. "Naturally, this will cost a lot of money, that's true.  But the experience of this catastrophe, like that of so many others, has shown us that timely precautions, while they cost money, are cheaper in the long run than fixing the damage afterwards -- and that is not even counting the human suffering."  </field>

<field name="text">There were new developments in the affair of Manfred Wulfert, the [former?] CDU Treasurer in Saxony-Anhalt.  He is suspected of having arranged a contract murder with the Russian Mafia. According to German Midlands Radio [Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk], the party and the Federal Interior Ministry were acquainted with the politician's financial problems earlier than was previously thought.  In addition, a Berlin construction business owner, Mr. Matthes, has lodged serious charges against Wulfert. Matthes stated that he is a friend of Detlef Luchs, the intended murder victim, as well as of the Russian who is alleged to have received the contract.  And that is not all.  German Midlands Radio has several documents that the Berlin businessman sent to the Federal Interior Ministry and the national CDU secretariat.  Their contents verge on the unbelievable.  One document, dated April 25, 1998 and addressed to the Federal Interior Ministry, was captioned "Re: Contract Murder -- Preliminary Investigation of CDU State Representative Wulfert."  Matthes maintains in this memo that Wulfert, his business partner, had run into a liquidity bottleneck and had borrowed 50,000 DM from Detlef Luchs.  When Wulfert couldn't pay the money back, he approached the Russian in order to solve the problem another way.  Matthes says he is certain that Luchs was supposed to be killed.  Sources close to the investigation say that on March 29th of this year, the Russian told Wulfert over a cell phone that he would kill Luchs for 20,000 DM.  Investigators were listening in on the cell phone conversation, and the Russian was arrested in a country hotel.  </field>

<field name="text">German Rail confirmed that it is planning a new scheduling system.  A spokeswoman said that Yes, it was true that consideration was being given to dropping strict per-kilometer pricing.  This does not mean that there is going to be a rise or a fall in prices, she continued.  Rather, the new prices might be adjusted according to the time in transit, the luxury class, and the competition from planes and cars on specific routes.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government is said to be introducing a new wage supplement to relieve pressure on the labor market.  The program is called the "Combination Wage" and will be provided to some workers from the beginning of August, according to the Labor Ministry in Bonn.  According to "Der Spiegel," the government wants to subsidize low-wage jobs with this additional supplement.  The Combination Wage should give the unemployed an incentive to take a job that pays a below-average wage.  </field>

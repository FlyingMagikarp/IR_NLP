<field name="text">The Ministry of Defence is investigating new accusations of extreme right-wing activity in the German army. According to a report on the ZDF television channel, two German soldiers from the SFOR peace-keeping force in Bosnia insulted Albanian soldiers, using Nazi slogans. A spokesman for the Ministry admitted that it was possible that two uncommissioned officers had used anti-Semitic insults against two Albanian soldiers who were on guard in Bosnia last year. Up till now, the ministry had claimed that the soldiers were very drunk, and that it could not be proven that they had used such insults. Defence Minister Ruehe's plan to check up on every soldier regularly for possible extreme right-wing sympathies has come in for criticism. Penner, an SPD politician who is the president of the Bundestag's committee on internal affairs, has warned that this should not lead to a general feeling of mistrust towards the army. Army Chief of Staff Bagger has called on soldiers to show more courage in opposing right-wing extremism, but he also warned against creating an atmosphere of 'snooping on your comrades.'  </field>

<field name="text">Before the start of the mediation process on the new surveillance law, the so-called 'great surveillance attack,' politicians from the CDU/CSU have said that all exceptions to the law for members of specific occupations that have been agreed up till now should be scrapped. Manfred Kanther, the Minister of the Interior, emphasised in an interview with the 'Berliner Morgenpost' newspaper, that there was no possibility that further occupations might be exempted, and said that he was ready to scrap the exemptions that had already been won by the SPD, agreeing with what the leader of the CDU parliamentary party, Wolfgang Schaeuble, has already said. The SPD rejected this initiative. The mediation leader for the SPD, Schily, said that he would think it somewhat adventurous for the CDU/CSU to believe that the SPD would allow the exemptions to be scrapped and were hoping to win more. The German Press Council has accused Schaeuble of wanting to chip away at the freedom of the press and of hindering any attempts to improve it.  </field>

<field name="text">The German economy's export surplus of more than DM 121 billion last year was highest since the Re-unification of Germany. According to the Federal Statistics Office, which is based in Wiesbaden, goods with a value of more than DM 887 billion were exported in 1997; this was more than 12.5% more than in the previous year. Around DM 765 billion worth of goods were imported, which represents an increase of 10.9%. The export boom, which was in part due to favourable exchange rates, helped to halve the balance of payments deficit from 1996 to around DM 10 billion. Besides the export surplus, the balance of payments also includes international money transfers and the money spent by German holiday-makers.  </field>

<field name="text">It now seems likely that thousands of German cattle were destroyed in error in connection with BSE. A report carried by the 'Deutschlandfunk' broadcasting company, based on information from the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, claims that mistakes were made in the investigation into the first alleged case of BSE in cattle in Germany. The disease was confirmed in the sample, but it has been proven that the sample itself did not come from Bavarian cow with suspected BSE. Following the investigation, 3,000 cattle of British and Swiss origin were destroyed in Bavaria alone last year.  </field>

<field name="text">Greens Party Spokesperson Juergen Trittin announced today a reduction of pension and unemployment insurance of up to 4%. The incurred costs of DM 70 billion will be financed through an eco tax imposed on power consumption. Mr Trittin did not say how expensive gasoline will become.  The Social Democrats and the Greens agree on higher energy taxes and lower non-wage labour costs. Mr Scharping said that they want to have ecological elements in the tax system which offer incentives to conserve resources, especially power. Scharping does not want to be a part of the gasoline debate. Trittin, on the other hand, explained that concerning gas prices, Germany ranks 13th within the European Union. Several countries have reached a price of DM 2.00 per litre, so there is a lot of room for negotiation.  CDU's Parliamentary Leader Schaeuble protested against the accusation that the old parliament had hampered with balance sheets. "It is a lie that the Social Democrats now know something they didn't know before. All numbers we put on the table in early September were accurate."  </field>

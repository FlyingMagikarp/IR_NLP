<field name="text">The federal state, the individual German states, and communities will have to make do with almost DM40bn less in tax revenues for this and the next year than planned in the budget. This is the bottom line of the new tax revenue forecast published today by the Federal Finance Ministry in Bonn. According to calculations of the committee for tax revenue forecasts, the total splits into DM17.3bn less this year, and DM22.4bn next year. The federal budget will be affected by approximately one sixth of these amounts.  Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel reassured that Germany will nonetheless satisfy the budget deficit criteria for the Euro [that is for taking part in the European Monetary Union (EMU)]. Already in the morning the coalition had agreed on measures to compensate for the lost revenues. In particular these measures include another postponement in the repayment of the "Erblastentilgungsfond" (Debt Redemption Fund). This fond services the debts of former East-Germany. Mr Waigel called on the [German] states and communities to continue their efforts to consolidate the budget. According to internal coalition reports, Mr Waigel also intends to sell many more Deutsche Telekom shares than planned earlier.  The SPD calls the numbers of the new forecast catastropic. SPD parliamentary party leader Rudolf Scharping demanded to take firmer action against tax dumping and tax fraud. The Confederation of German Unions (DGB) demanded a tax revenue action programme.  </field>

<field name="text">The preference given to women when applying for jobs or promotions in the public sector does not as such violate European law. The European Court decided today that North Rhine-Westphalia's Women Promotion bill is in line with European law. Quotas were allowed as long as men with equal qualifications would not be discriminated automatically. The ruling decided a case filed by a teacher who considered his promotion treated unfairly due the North Rhine-Westphalia's women quota.  Politicians, unions and women activists' groups unanimously welcomed the decision. North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister for Women's Equalisation Rydda Melchers (sp?) called today a historic day for women in Europe.  Federal Minister for Women Claudia Nolte said the ruling provides for more clarity in this matter. SPD and the Greens said they felt being confirmed in their women's policy. The union for public service and transportation (OeTV) said the decision reaffirmed there legal conception of women quota.  </field>

<field name="text">The coalition parties CDU, CSU and FDP want to start new negotiations with the SPD on changes in the pension system and in the tax system. Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel said all the [coalition] parties support this new offer of talks. Given the new slump in tax revenues, he asked the SPD to no longer block a structural reform of the tax system. When it comes to the pension system, it was absolutely necessary to prevent an increase of pension contributions to 21% from next year on.  </field>

<field name="text">Leader of CSU members of parliament Michael Glos believes that the increase of pension contributions to 21% [of payed out wages and salaries] from next year on can no longer be stopped. Mr Glos said it was dangerous not to increase the value added tax (VAT) [also known as goods and services tax - GST - or sales tax] at the beginning of next year. It was, however, impossible to put this increase into effect by January. Therefore CDU's and FDP's demand to advance the reform of the pension system and the VAT increase by one year to January 1998 was unrealistic.  </field>

<field name="text">SPD financial expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier has reproached the governing coalition for not fighting firmly enough against unemployment. In a radio interview she said the core of the problem was not taxes but the level of social security contributions. This leads to too high a burden on work costs. Ms Matthaeus-Maier believes that profits, not losses should be rewarded. Therefore the SPD wants a minimum tax for "write-off artists" who declare a negative total income.  </field>

<field name="text">According to a leading decision of the Federal Labour Court, the privacy commissioner of a company is not allowed to monitor the computers of the workers' representation. Such a supervision would contradict the independency of the workers' representation required by the industrial relations scheme.

<field name="text">Today the Federal Constitutional Court started the hearing of a case filed by the Federal government against a passage in the current radio and television acts of the different states, allowing for brief sports reporting on television free of charge.

<field name="text">The CDU/FDP coalition in Stuttgart won't be able to continue its current policy of austerity. Baden-Wuerttemberg's State Premier Erwin Teufel said the expected hugh decrease in tax revenues could not be balanced through savings in the budget anymore. Therefore further loans have to be taken out. Mr Teufel expressed his concern that the state's 1998 tax revenue could be as much as DM1.2 billion below earlier forecasts. As a further measure to counter this slump in revenues a general spending stop has been imposed.  </field>

<field name="text">Snow, ice and cold temperatures have caused more mayhem on Europe's roads. In North and East Germany ferries had to battle with high seas and the elements. Approximately two thirds of all German domestic barges are tied up, as canals are completely frozen. In Germany, all trains were running late, and some flights had to be cancelled. Sleet and snow are predicted for Southwest Germany this weekend.  </field>

<field name="text">Close to three years after the collapse of real-estate tycoon Mr Schneider's company, the public prosecutor now took him to court. He is mainly accused of fraudulent bankruptcy and obtaining loans through fraud. Mr Schneider allegedly forged documents to obtain loans, and also laundered 250 million marks through Swiss bank accounts.  Mr Schneider's lawyers pointed out that the banks had not only been very accommodating, but almost taken an active part in Mr Schneider's business.  In 1994, Mr Schneider had caused Germany's biggest real-estate bankruptcy so far, involving moneys to the tune of 5 billion marks. Mr Schneider and his wife had subsequently left for Florida, where they were arrested in 1995 and extradited to Germany. Mrs Schneider meanwhile was released from prison.  </field>

<field name="text">Last year Germans ate 10% less beef, viz. 1.2 million (metric) tons of beef and veal, according to official statistics. The lower demand, attributed to perceived potential health-risks due to BSE, had led to considerable over-supply and dramatic price-cuts.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Vogt, SPD spokes-person for external affairs, emphasised the requirement for NATO to be expanded to comprise former Communist countries in Eastern Europe. He said that this would be necessary to stabilise both Russia's western and NATO's eastern borders. He emphasised that this would also facilitate the returning of a region, that had been a bone of contention between between Russia and Germany and Russia for centuries, to the fold of an international security organisation.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Schaeuble, head of the joint CDU/CSU parliamentary group, said that employers and unions would have to take part of the blame for continued high unemployment in Germany. He criticised both for not having made good use of the leeway government had provided, to foster employment and growth. At the same time, Mr Schaeuble put a damper on expectations that solidarity-surtax would be phased out until the year 2000. Only snake-oil vendors would promise such a thing. Secretary General Westerwelle, of the FDP, however, confirmed his party's goal to get rid of the surtax until the year 2000.  </field>

<field name="text">The alleged perpetrators, accused of four attacks on ALDI supermarkets using explosives last spring, admitted that they had done it, right at the beginning of the trial. The two brothers from Halle told the Regional Court they had wanted to hold the supermarket chain to ransom, to the tune of 3 million marks, and use the money to set up a restaurant. The 23- and 27-year old men hid explosives in juice-packs and left them at ALDI-branches in several cities.  </field>

<field name="text">The association "Lobby for persons without fixed abode and the poor" appealed to the communes to make sure people would not freeze during the current cold snap. Public buildings and train stations should stay open all night. Mr Moirer, the association's president, criticised on radio Deutschlandfunk, that hardly any German town or city kept heated underground (subway) stations open at night, to accommodate squatters. And even during the day, the authorities, for example in Frankfurt, would try and evict squatters. Any public servant causing a squatter to freeze to death would be guilty of manslaughter. Mr Moirer asked for a telephone hotline to be set up, for the use of squatters in distress or emergency situations.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Muentefehring, federal manager of the SPD, asked politicians for renewed efforts to fight the plight of people without fixed abode. The recent cold snap had caused the death of 20 persons, who would have survived had they lived in flats. It would be quite wrong to blame their death on the cold weather: they had died from poverty and isolation. Reducing unemployment would be the main factor in fighting the problem of squatters.  </field>

<field name="text">Baden-Wuerttemberg's economics minister Doering spoke out against the introduction of a levy for the use of German autobahns, as a toll-charge would only mean fleecing motorists once again. He added, that whoever tried to ape the Austrians (who had recently introduced a levy for the use of their autobahns) would do so mainly for populist reasons.  </field></doc></add>

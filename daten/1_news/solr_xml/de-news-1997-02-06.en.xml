<field name="text">In face of roughly 4.7 million jobless people, the political dispute about solutions has grown more violent.  The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) has demanded immediate measures to increase the employment rate.  The DGB considers the latest figures as ultimate proof of a failed economic policy of the government.  DGB vice chair, Ms. Ursula Engelen-Kefer, said now we have to pay the bill for reduction of social welfare, restrictions on lay-off protection and slashing bad weather compensation for construction workers.  In the opinion of the DGB, the country is drifting into dangerous currents and needs a completely novel policy.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin is accusing former Chancellor Helmut Kohl of intentional breach of the law. She told the "Berliner Zeitung" newspaper that Kohl has been acting in defiance of the law for years. She also condemned the former German leader's incremental admissions. The spokesman for the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag committee investigating the CDU donation affair, Andreas Schmidt, has begun defending Kohl. Schmidt said it was mean and brutal for SPD members within the committee to threaten having Kohl placed under police custody. He added that it was only appropriate to wait and hear what Kohl would say in his testimony. The SPD chairman of the committee, Volker Neumann, said that the law provides for fines or even detention in cases in which a witness does not have the right to refuse to give evidence but does refuse anyway. Kohl admitted in an interview on ZDF television last Thursday that he had accepted cash from donors, but he repeatedly made clear in the following days that he had no intention of naming names. Meanwhile, new details have come to light concerning the Leuna affair, which the committee is also to investigate. Today's "Welt" newspaper reports that in the sale of the East German Leuna refinery to the French petroleum company Elf-Aquitaine, bribes were paid to individuals connected with the Treuhand [trust administration established following German reunification to oversee the privatization of firms formerly owned by the East German government]. It is expected that those funds were used to cover phony investment plans, in order to acquire federal subsidies worth billions of D-Marks.  </field>

<field name="text">The German power companies continue to reject an overall 30-year lifespan for nuclear power plants. The president of the Union of German Power Plants, Heinz Klinger, said that that period, as demanded by the Green Party, would not allow the plants economic viability. He said a reactor must be on-line for at least 35 years. He indicated that the reactors in question were in working order, and that it would be nothing short of the destruction of capital to shut them down.  </field>

<field name="text">Heavy snowfall and black ice led to serious traffic problems in much of Germany. Sixteen people died in collisions. The states of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, and the Saarland were especially affected. Fallen trees blocked roads and rail lines. On the autobahn encircling Karlsruhe alone there have been almost 60 collisions since yesterday, injuring nine people. The airports in Stuttgart, Frankfurt, and Munich had to delay many flights for several hours, or cancel them altogether. In the meantime, the situation has generally eased. Falling temperatures overnight, however, mean that black ice continues to be a serious danger.  </field>

<field name="text">A renewed quarrel has broken out between CSU and FDP over questions of policy towards the European Union. Bavaria's state premier Stoiber came out in favor of taking competence on European Union policies out of the foreign ministry's hands. In an interview to news magazine "Focus", Stoiber advocated creating a special ministry for Europe as practiced by other European countries. The new minister would report directly to the federal chancellor. The foreign ministry, in Stoiber's opinion, thinks too much along diplomatic lines to be able to forcefully fight for internal German interests. FDP parliamentary leader Solms defended foreign minister Kinkel against Stoiber's criticism. In Bonn, he said European policy could not be in better hands than Kinkel's. FDP honorary chairman Genscher warned that with this kind of talk, Stoiber was putting in jeopardy the Union's electoral prospects.  FDP boss Gerhard said Bavaria's state premier must understand that CSU has no claim on supervising German foreign policy.  </field>

<field name="text">Christian around the world remembered the passion and death of Jesus Christ this Good Friday. Thousands of pilgrims followed the trail of the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, which according to tradition is the path Christ followed on his way to be crucified. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers watched over the procession, fearing terrorist attacks by Arab extremists. In Rome, Pope John Paul II followed the ancient tradition of hearing confessions of the faithful in St. Peter's basilica. Towards nightfall, the head of the Catholic church will pray the Via Crucis in the Colosseum. In Germany, catholic and evangelical Christians remembered Christs sacrifice with processions and special services. In Munich, the first Good Friday procession in 200 years took place. The bishop of the Bavarian Lutheran Church, von Loewenich, said Good Friday was a day not only of mourning but, for Christians, the day of forgiveness. In Cologne, catholic archbishop Meissner called on all faithful to be ready to serve in love.  </field>

<field name="text">One out of every three Germans has no idea what Easter is all about, according to a survey conducted by EMNID institute. In Western Germany, three out of four persons were aware that Easter is celebrated in memory of Christ's resurrection, against 58% in Eastern Germany. In catholic circles, talk has revived on establishing a fixed date for Easter. In 325 A.D., Easter was decided to be held on the Sunday following the first full moon in spring. In our century, the League of Nations and Pope Paul VI proposed to change the date to the second Sunday in April. This proposal is now being brought up again within the Catholic Church.  </field>

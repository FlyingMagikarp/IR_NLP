<field name="text">During a debate in the Bundestag, Walter Riester, the Federal Employment Minister (SPD), has warned that people should not expect too much from the planned pension reform. Riester promised that all the money raised by the new eco-tax would be used to lower pension contributions, but, he said, it would not be possible to do everything that would be desirable. Riester welcomed the suggestion from trade unions that the pensionable age should be lowered. Andrea Fischer, the Federal Minister of Health, announced that she is planning substantial changes in health policy, and introduced into the Bundestag an immediate programme to cut the cost of health care for patients. The CDU/CSU and the FDP criticised her programme, claiming that the government would not have the money to finance it.  </field>

<field name="text">The red-green federal government is once again discussing pension reform. The German Federation of Unions (DGB) has asked the CDU and CSU to collaborate on a reform plan.  Deputy DGB Chair Ursula Engelen-Kefer suggests that the pensions should continue grow in proportion with take-home pay but that family benefits should increase at a slower rate. She said that retired people have no children to feed and shouldn't profit from increased state benefits for families and children. This was the reasoning behind her plan, which should to keep personal pension contributions basically stable.  But if retirement income were no longer linked to take-home pay, there would be a justified fear that retired people might eventually have their needs pushed to the side and overlooked.  The last scenario is not an option for the DGB vice-chairperson. In an interview with the "Neu Osnabruecker Zeitung," Engelen-Kefer stated that the rise in the inflation rate predicted by Labor Minister Riester would reduce the buying power of pensions by roughly 1% next year. For the DGB, this is a significant reduction in pensions and not acceptable. Before the pension plan ends up before the Federal Constitutional Court, pension adjustments should continue to be linked to take-home pay for the next few years.  However, the increases should be significantly reduced by rise in child benefits and applying the accumulated fund set aside for that purpose. Her suggestion could give a new impetus to the discussion on pension reform.  Koch, minister president of the CDU, stressed that his party would be prepared to join in on the pension reform dialogue as soon as the federal government gives up the idea of letting pensions grow at the rate of inflation for the next two years.  Federal Chancellor Schroeder announced that he wants to schedule meetings with all parties and groups to discuss the pension issue after the summer hiatus.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal foreign minister Joschka Fischer has become active in the nuclear energy debate. He met yesterday with leaders of major power companies. According to the Ministry of the Environment, the meeting was agreed to by both Fischer and Juergin Trittin, the Minister under whose responsibility nuclear power falls.  Fischer must clear find some way of compromising. The power companies and numerous politicians accuse Trittin of being unwilling to compromise on the nuclear phase-out process. Fischer's plan met with wide acceptance at the Greens' state party congress in Lindau. At the start of the meeting, Margarete Bause, chair of the Bavarian Greens, called for her party to show more commitment to and unity with the government. The state head of the Greens told members they had to get into the streets if they wanted to put wind in the sails of energy policies. That was the only way to achieve a real nuclear phase-out.  Federal chair Antje Radcke was against making too many compromises. After she welcomed the participation of Foreign Minister Fischer in the latest round of talks with the nuclear power industry, she warned the approximately 250 delegates against always wanting to make environmental policy strictly through consensus.  </field>

<field name="text">The traditional meeting in Germany of Silesian farmers began in Nuremberg this morning. The two-day event has the motto, "Acknowledging Silesia: 50 years of Silesian Agriculture." The meeting takes place every two years. Event organizers expected up to 100,000 visitors. Herbert Hupka, chair of the Silesian farmers' organization, spoke of a very productive German-Polish dialogue between the farmers group and official representatives of the Polish government. He said there have been great successes in Silesia the past decade.  Nonetheless, there are still problems. German is allowed but there are not enough German-speaking teachers. In addition, Hupka pressed the desirability of bilingual street signs in Silesia. In addition, those Silesians driven from their homes demand a right of residence and an investigation of disputed property issues. Poland's accession to the EU will also bring new solutions, Mr. Hupka added.  </field>

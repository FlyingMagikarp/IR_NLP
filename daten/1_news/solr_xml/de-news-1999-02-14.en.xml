<field name="text">The IG Metall union will accept unstructured arbitration in the wage conflict in the industry. The union's federal executive suggested former Justice Minister Hans-Jochen Vogel (SPD) as arbitrator, and the Employers' Association in Baden-Wuerttemberg has accepted. According to the president of the state Association, Fritsche, arbitration will likely begin on Tuesday. The union, however, has set a deadline of midnight the next day, Wednesday; failing results at that time, the union will initiate a first-stage strike vote, with an eye to labour action in Baden-Wuerttemberg on February 22. The employers had made the offer of special arbitration in the hope of yet avoiding a strike. The union, however, expects a significantly better wage offer, and intends to maintain its hard-nosed stance, unwilling to accept any offer dependent upon employers' earnings. Union boss, Klaus Zwickel, said that the workers' representatives in the factory committees had, over the last few weeks, come out against compromise on that point because they knew that that would 'make them more vulnerable to blackmail from the employers'. Zwickel also said that he hopes there remain enough reasonable voices in the employers' camp helping to avert a strike. The union boss called the imminent arbitration talks the final attempt at a peaceful solution to the conflict. President of the national Employers' Association, Dieter Hundt, has once more warned IG Metall against a strike. He said a labor battle would strangle economic growth, and a strike would put newly-created jobs at risk.  </field>

<field name="text">The tone within the Red-Green coalition is getting sharper. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder today accused the Greens of a deficient sense of reality. Obviously thinking of the controversial withdrawal from nuclear energy, Schroeder said on ZDF television that a decision's chances of success must not be assessed only after the fact; rather, he said, the coalition had to debate it first. Federal Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, on the other hand, complained that political agreements with the SPD often had a half-life of mere hours.  </field>

<field name="text">Premier Gerhard Glogowski of Lower Saxony expects store hours to be loosened even more in the future. In a newspaper interview, the Social Democrat said that, given the growing-together of Europe, and increasing competition in the big cities, the need for greater flexibility could not be ruled out. He added, however, that efforts must be undertaken to implement changes in a socially responsible manner.  </field>

<field name="text">Following the death of an Algerian asylum-seeker, several groups have called for rallies in the city of Guben in the state of Brandenburg. A vigil was to be held this afternoon, attended, by State Premier Manfred Stolpe, among others. The 28-year-old Algerian, along with another foreigner, was hounded through the city yesterday morning by young right-wing radicals. According to police, the man cut open an artery in his leg when he tried to reach safety by jumping through the glass door of an apartment building, and bled to death. Five youths between 17 and 18 years old have been taken into custody, all known for previous acts of violence and right-wing rhetoric, and will face a magistrate today. The Public Prosecutor's Office is asking for warrants to arrest them for manslaughter, coercion, and disturbing the peace.  </field>

<field name="text">More and more children and youths under the age of 18 in Germany are dependent on social aid. The number of officially registered recipients in the East has doubled within six years, and in the same time has also risen significantly in the West. According to statistics presented today by the Federal Press Office, more than 1 million children and youths were receiving social aid at the end of 1997. On average, 68 of every 1000 children depended upon support from the social agencies of the country.  </field>

<field name="text">Labour Minister Walter Riester says it is possible that pensions may, in future, no longer be tied to net increases in income. He said that tax reforms and a recent Constitutional Court ruling in favour of families will increase net incomes so much, that the established method of calculation would bankrupt the pension funds. Thus, as Riester told BILD newspaper, that method must be reassessed.  </field></doc></add>

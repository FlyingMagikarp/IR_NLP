<field name="text">Parliament's governing coalition-parties passed the 1998 budget, as well as the additional budget for 1997. During the final debate, there were signs of a certain inclination to compromise, as far as the tax-reforms were concerned. And that was also true for the Upper House (Bundesrat), as far as the planned pension-reforms were concerned. The FDP will give up their original plea for a net lowering of the tax-burden in the first instance, and they also agreed to not ask for pension-reforms to be tackled as early as next year. Head of the opposition SPD-party Oskar Lafontaine stated that now there should not be any problem getting the legislation through both Houses straight away - meaning sales tax would go up by 1% as of 1 April 1998. This would enable contributions to the compulsory pension-scheme to stay at 20.3%. The SPD for their part gave up plans to raise 'petrol-tax' and do away with reforms of the so-called 610-mark jobs (very popular, as they are exempt from social-security contributions, and only the employer pays 'a bit of' tax).  Mr Lafontaine, however, wants a compromise based on his party's plans. The FDP in turn added a qualifier to their's: they will agree to pension-reforms, provided the SPD will come to the party as far as tax-reforms are concerned. Government and Mr Lafontaine had already been on the phone about the matter, and they had agreed to keep the conversations confidential, which would also go for a first round of talks following the SPD Party Congress next week.  </field>

<field name="text">In view of the dire straits public finances are in, the states want to have another look at how money could be saved in their budgets. According to Bavaria's Premier Stoiber, public servants would not be exempt from scrutiny. All premiers agreed that a big reform of the tax-system would be what they wanted. Baden-Wuerttemberg's premier Teufel saw some signs of hope, looking at the narrowing of the rift between CDU and SPD, as well as the FDP: "We, the state premiers, agree that it would be excellent if taxes were reformed until the upcoming federal elections. And well done to all concerned, who've started talking to each other once again."  </field>

<field name="text">For the time being, there will be no further public money for the FDP-party, as Speaker Suessmuth (Bundestagspraesidentin) decided today to put a hold on the instalment due on 1 December (2 million marks). She stated that this was due to the matter being under investigation by the Cologne Administrative Court. The judges intend to rule on 10 December if the FDP received 12.4 million marks in 1996 without being entitled to them - due to some procedural errors.  </field>

<field name="text">The Brandenburg state government intends to spend more than five million marks on boosting the region around the river Oder, which had been badly hit by last summer's floods. Until 2010 some 770 million marks will be spent on flood-protection measures, according to State Premier Stolpe. The biggest chunk would be spent on repairing and upgrading roads. Apart from that, money would also be spent on getting towns and villages up to scratch, plus economic development of the area.  </field>

<field name="text">The Baden-Wuerttemberg government wants to reorganise the hours worked by their teachers. This would fill gaps caused by lack of teachers, according to Education Minister Schavan. Teachers are to work another hour per week for the next five years: in return, they will work one hour less per week as of 2008. This would be compulsory for all teachers aged between 30 and 49 years - except for secondary school teachers.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Federal Court of Justice did not allow an appeal against the sentence of former SPD top-politician Wienand. Mr Wienand now will have to serve 2 1/2 years in prison, and pay back a million marks in fees he received as an agent. Between 1976 and 1989, Mr Wienand had passed on internals and personal observations to his contact-person in the then East German Secret Service. He would have received close to 1.3 million marks for his services, which the court thought most certainly were not mitigating circumstances. Mr Wienand had complained that two eventual witnesses for the defence had not been heard, but that argument was shot down by the court: the two witnesses had been members of the GDR Secret Service staff, and therefore unfit as witnesses for the defence. As Mr Markus Wolf, former head of the GDR Secret Service, had already stated that he would not testify in case he was asked to be a witness for the defence (which he was entitled to), the court did not consider him either.  </field>

<field name="text">Defence counsel joined ranks with the public prosecutor, asking for a life-sentence for the murderer of 10-year old Kim Kerkow. The accused, Rolf Diesterweg, had the last word: "I'm a man who has become guilty, I've done something bad. I expect to get life, and I deserve it." The worst, in his opinion, would be if he did not get treatment. As Mr Diesterweg had made a full confession, defence counsel did not plead against life. It would make sense to start treating him straight away, and it would not matter if this took place in jail or in a psychiatric care hospital.  </field></doc></add>

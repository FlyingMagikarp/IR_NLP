<field name="text">The federal government has put a resolution of the EU-summit in Luxembourg into action and submitted a plan of action for employment policy.  The core of the program as presented is strengthened assistance for unemployed young persons, as well as the long-term unemployed.  The necessary funds are to come primarily from the reorganization of existing budget appropriations.  Minister of Economics Rexrodt stressed that labor policy is primarily a national affair.  The Greens accused the government of activism; the unions criticized the program as being largely without substance or perspective.  </field>

<field name="text">The German printing industry is on course for a labor dispute.  IG Medien, the industry union, today explained that collective bargaining for the approximately 200,000 employees has failed.  The no-conflict period between the industry and the union expires at the end of April.  A union spokes-person in Stuttgart said the employers do not seem prepared to substantially improve their offer of a 1.5% increase in salaries and wages.  The employers' association said that the decision by IG Medien made no sense.  The employers offer was a reasonable and solid base for negotiation, said a spokesperson for the employers' association, and referred to settlements in the civil service and construction industry.  The negotiations will  continue on May 13th, in Frankfurt/Main.  </field>

<field name="text">Minister of Finance Waigel criticized the German states for their continuing failure to agree on the national stability pact for which he had asked. At a meeting of the CDU economic council in Bonn, Waigel said if the states did not reach an agreement at their conference tomorrow, he would introduce his own version of the bill.  The pact would specify fixed debt ceilings for the country, the states and municipalities.  In addition it will contain penalty provisions to apply if the allowable deficit criteria are exceeded.  The chairperson of the council, Murmann (sp?), also called for a reorganization of the federal transfer payments.  </field>

<field name="text">The FDP defended the resolution of its party congress to repeal the solidarity tax.  During a question period in the Bundestag, FDP General Secretary Westerwelle as well as politicians of the CDU/CSU stressed that abolishing the surcharge implies no reduction in solidarity with the former East German states.  Representatives of the opposition, from the SDP and Green parties, strengthened their criticism of Liberals, saying that they intended to deprive the East German states of support.  They also claimed that this move demonstrates how little interest leading politicians of the Bonn coalition seem to have for the problems of East Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">The French organizers of the World Soccer Championship only sold 15,000 tickets today, despite more than 20 million telephone inquiries.  The remaining 90,000 tickets will be sold over the next several days, according to a spokesperson.  The onslaught of soccer fans paralyzed European telephone networks.  In Brussels meanwhile, 30 delegates of the European parliament said they had submitted complaints to Paris about what was in their view an unfair distribution of tickets for the soccer games, saying that it is against European law for only 1/4 of the 2.5 million tickets to be sold outside of France.  </field></doc></add>

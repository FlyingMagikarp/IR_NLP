<field name="text">The Upper House (Bundesrat) has given its consent to a whole raft of new laws.  If someone applies for asylum and there is proof they have done so in order to obtain benefits, they will have their benefits cut drastically. This is targeted against new refugees getting into Germany in order to be on the social welfare benefit. The new rule would also apply to applicants who have been turned down but try to foil deportation orders by destroying their identification papers. There are, however, exceptions, for example for foreigners who are allowed to stay for the time being.  </field>

<field name="text">CDU politician Geissler warned the ruling CDU/CSU parties against using policies against foreigners for election purposes. This would only raise a lot of hackles without achieving a thing, and distract from the real issues, according to an interview with the Berlin newspaper BERLINER MORGENPOST. And this would also be true for all the others who currently were pushing for stricter policies in this area. There should rather be a global concept how to integrate foreign residents in Germany. At the same time, poverty and civil war in many foreigners' home countries should be fought (sic!), according to Mr Geissler.  </field>

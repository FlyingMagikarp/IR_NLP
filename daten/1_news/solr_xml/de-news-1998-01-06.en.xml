<field name="text">FDP party leader Wolfgang Gerhardt has called on his party to stop the internal quarreling. Mr. Gerhardt said at the traditional Liberal Epiphany congress in Stuttgart that the political opponent was the one to be fought. He, Gerhardt, would defend the party's established direction. The wrongest thing for the FDP to do now would be to deviate from the current path.  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Baden-Wuerttemberg's State Premier Walter Doering also demanded an end to the arguments within the party. Kinkel demanded more resoluteness and moral courage. The Liberals should aim at preventing a red-green [Social-Democrat--Alliance90/Green] or a Grand Coalition [CDU/CSU/SPD] in the 1998 general elections. FDP secretary-general Guido Westerwelle announced that the party would deal with Alliance90/Greens during the election campaign because they represented a threat to Germany's Liberality. Before the congress former justice minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger repeated her criticism of the FDP's leadership. In a radio interview she questioned again the tone used to rebuke her criticism. She reproached especially Baden-Wuerttemberg's FDP leader Walter Doering with slander. To reject concerns of the party's left wing as boastful twaddle. The FDP politician who belongs to the left-Liberal Freiburger Kreis demanded again that her party must insist on more liberality within the party. It was not sufficient to concentrate on economic and finance politics. Yesterday, leading FDP politicians had called on the party to show more unanimity and demanded to end the unnecessary internal discussions.  </field>

<field name="text">Deutsche Telekom AG [the former monopolist for long-distance phone calls] renounces fees for switching customers to other long-distance carriers for the time being. The change of mind came about because the regulatory authority has deemed that such fees needed their approval.

<field name="text">Baden-Wuerttemberg's State Premier Erwin Teufel has called on the federal government to insist more on the protection of the external EU borders from illegal immigrants. According to the state government Mr. Teufel wrote in a letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl that quick and decisive action was mandatory. It was known that illegal immigrants chose the route from Italy and France to Baden-Wuerttemberg. Mr. Teufel demanded border checks at the German-French border by the Border Guards. According to Interior Minister Manfred Kanther the federal government has taken all measures against a possible wave of Kurdish refugees into Germany. Kanther said in a radio interview that the Border Guards at the southern and western borders had been backed up.  The president of the police union, Mr. Lutz, rejected more police controls at  German borders. The refugee problem could not be solved by improving the control at German borders. Rather, Turkey had to change its Kurds policy. Lutz also advocated to fight international refugee traffickers by more international cooperation. CDU law expert Rupert Scholz, however, called for a closure of the German borders if Italy could not secure its borders more effectively.  </field>

<field name="text">Germany and Mexico want to further extend their relations, following Chancellor Kohl's trip to Mexico. No economic treaties were signed, though Mexico told Mr Kohl that they would like a trade agreement with the EU.  "We want to build a European house, not a fortress" was Mr Kohl's motto on day two of his visit. And Mexico liked what they heard, as they used to think that the EU's tariff-policy was meant to keep them out. Mexico expects Mr Kohl to back their plans for a free trade agreement, something out of the question at the moment, "as currently Europe has no shortage of agricultural problems of their own". German investment prospects, however, look a bit more promising. Managers travelling with Mr Kohl said that they intended to invest another 3 billion marks in their Mexican subsidiaries until the end of this century.  </field>

<field name="text">Berlin and Hamburg will start re-patriating Bosnian refugees, by force if need be, as early as 1 October. They will, however, try moral suasion first. Though all state ministers for internal affairs had agreed on the measures, it is up to them when and how they proceed. This also covers residents from Bosnia-Herzegovina who entered Germany after the Dayton accords, who do not have refugee-status.  </field>

<field name="text">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that a secret service staff-member had been seconded to serve with the German EU-observers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was in reaction to a television documentary claiming the secret service member would use his observer-status for spying, and had been involved in illegal arms-deals. The German Foreign Intelligence Agency (BND) had strongly refuted the allegations.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Foreign Minister Kinkel asked for new ways of reaching agreement within the EU, as far as foreign and security policies were concerned. When delivering the closing speech at the 61st meeting of the German Bar Association at Karlsruhe, he criticised the requirement of unanimous decisions. There was no way the EU would survive in the 21st century if each and every member-country could block the EU's actions by single-handedly throwing a spanner in the works.  </field>

<field name="text">SPD and governing coalition parties met for talks, or more precisely, Finance Minister Waigel and Hamburg's mayor Voscherau met for a chat, according to press agency dpa and the newspaper FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG. Government coalition and SPD members of parliament think that Messrs Waigel and Voscherau get on well. But they do have a lot on their plate: the SPD wants tax-reforms within the next two years, and the FDP agrees, whereas Mr Waigel does not want to hear about it before 1999. Main bone of contention is the planned scrapping of estate- and asset-tax, meaning more than 13 billion marks less tax for the states. Apparently there is some leeway, though the SPD is adamant they want to raise child-benefits now (as agreed on, yet postponed by government). As the SPD has a majority in the Upper House (Bundesrat), they do have some clout.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bavarian federation of employers for the metal and electrical industry was the first employers federation to tell their members to start paying less for sick-leave. The cost-cutting laws, passed last week in Bonn, should start biting soon, according to a spokes-person of the federation. The unions said the employers were asking for trouble and had broken awards.  </field>

The awards still have not been settled, as employers do not want to pay penalty-rates for work after hours and on Saturdays, according to a union spokes-person. Negotiations will resume on 9 October.  </field>

<field name="text">The major items do not require the Upper House's (Bundesrat) consent, and may become law as early as January 1997. Keystone of the new regulations: if any health insurer raises their subscriptions, they will, by law, also have to raise all patients' excess (the amount they pay themselves when they require treatment), by a fixed amount of marks. A patient then would have to pay six or seven marks for a packet of tablets, on prescription, instead of the current five marks. And the same would apply to hospital costs, rehabilitation etc. There would be special exemptions for cases of hardship and low-wage earners (less than 1600 marks/month gross). If an insured person does not want to pay more, s/he may immediately resign from the current insurer and choose a less expensive one (currently they would have to wait for a year). The coalition is working on the assumption that no health-insurer will raise subscriptions, as they do not want to lose customers. And tooth-artwork, for example artificial teeth, would not be covered by public health-insurers any more. Patients would pay up-front, and get re-imbursed later (though not for the full amount). Special exemptions, as mentioned above, would also apply.  </field>

<field name="text">Britain will suspend slaughtering approx. 130,000 cows affected by BSE. According to a three-line message from 10 Downing Street, obviously drafted after hours, new scientific findings had to be taken into account, viz: First, according to an Oxford University computer model, BSE in Britain would have almost disappeared until 2001, and would have totally died out until 2002. Second: the number of cows able to cross-infect calves was lower than originally expected. The EU should look at these findings and take them into account when setting up a revised slaughtering-plan for Britain. This strategy has provided PM Major with a political breather. At the end of October, parliament's summer-recess will finish, and it is less than likely that the slaughtering-plans will attract any ayes in parliament. Mr Major now has bought a bit of time.  Germany criticised Britain's idea not to go ahead with slaughtering BSE-affected cows according to the EU's plans. Foreign Minister Kinkel said they would have to stick to the plan agreed to at the last EU-summit meeting in Florence/Italy. New measures were to be decided on only after scientists had come to a conclusion on this matter. German Federated Farmers were outraged: Britain was thumbing their nose at the Florence resolutions for electoral purposes. The Consumers' Federation said that Britain's behaviour was irresponsible. EU-Commissioner Fischler warned Britain to comply - or there would be no loosening of the export-ban.  </field>

<field name="text">Today is International Children's Day, and there was no shortage of events to draw the public's attention to children's rights and needs. According to UNICEF, more than 100 million children have to work under conditions that are inhumane and detrimental to their health, about 2 million girls and boys have to work as prostitutes and close to 200,000 children had served in the armed forces fighting the wars of the 80s. Germany's organisation pointed out that this country also had their share of poor, viz. more than 2 million children living in poverty. Federal Family Minister Nolte, CDU, advocated consistent prosecution of sexual child-abuse.  In Bonn several thousand children and young persons demonstrated for more rights for them. Displaying a 1.5 kilometre-long poster featuring 34,000 children's faces, they tried to draw the viewers' attention to the fact, that every day many children die through malnutrition and illness. The unions want International Children's Day abolished: they criticised that politicians take the chance to deliver speeches asking for more rights for children, while at the same time postponing raises in child-benefits and reducing the vote for education and young persons to a degree never experienced before.  </field>

<field name="text">German food-retailers are increasingly against genetically-engineered soy-beans from the US. According to Greenpeace, many retailers do not want to stock them, for example Karstadt and Markant (comprising affiliated COOP, Schlecker and Lidl chains). There were plans to introduce the soy-beans this autumn. Soy-beans are rich in protein and used in manufacturing chocolate, baby-food and nibbles.   </field>

<field name="text">On Tuesday the first witnesses will take the stand at the Peter Graf tax-trial. Today the court read from files compiled during the investigations. Mr Graf's application to get released on bail will be considered not before the beginning of next week. Who knew what and when - the main issue on day five of the trial. Many letters, contracts and memos were read, and their senders' names were more than interesting: Federal Finance Agency, Federal Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office Karlsruhe. Apparently the authorities even had copies of the Graf-family's contracts with their letter-box company Sunpark, in the Netherlands. And they knew what it was all about. According to a memo by the Federal Finance Agency, the non-resident Dutch letter-box company was merely rubber-stamping. In 1988 that same agency noted: "The revenue office at Schwetzingen will have to decide about any German tax-liability." According to today's hearings, Peter Graf had quite substantially leaned on the authorities to avoid paying tax - whereas the latter had been well informed and up with the play, for almost all of the last ten years.  </field>

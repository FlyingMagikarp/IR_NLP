<field name="text">The situation on Germany's job market improved only slightly in September. According to the data published by the Federal Labor Office today, the number of unemployed persons decreased by 53,000 to 3.9mio. The unemployment rate went down to 10.1%, compared to 10.2% in August. Compared to one year ago, this is however an increase by 1% or 300,000 unemployed persons, up from 9.1%. In West Germany the unemployment rate is now at 8.9%, and in the East at 14.7%. President of the Federal Labor Office Bernhard Jagoda said the usual consolidation of the job market in autumn was hard to recognize this year because of the weak economic growth. In the East the situation is better than in the West thanks to job creation schemes.  In Berlin, the unemployment rate decreased to 13.8% in September down from 14% a month ago. Compared to one year ago there were, however, 23,000 more job seekers. Only the eastern districts profited from the decrease this month - in the western districts the number of unemployed persons rose slightly. In the State of Brandenburg, the unemployment rate decreased from 14.6% a month ago to 14.4% in September.  </field>

<field name="text">A retirement age of 67 years and a lowering from 70% to 65% of the average net income was proposed by CDU social politics experts Mr. Luven and Mr. Kauder (sp?). The higher retirement age was justified by the higher life expectancy, the financial burdens of which can not be carried by today's contributors to the pension funds alone. In addition, a gradual decrease of the pensions level to 65% for a pensioner who worked for 45 years would be acceptable. The concept of old-age pension consisting of state pension, companies pension and private provision is not questioned by their proposal, they say.  </field>

<field name="text">The European Court ruled to day that the Federal Republic of Germany has to pay compensation to customers of several package tour operators after these companies went bankrupt. The judges declared the German State liable since it did not implement in time a directive of the European Union concerning package tours. According to the directive, tour operators were obliged since 1993 to prove, that they have sufficient financial reserves. A corresponding law was enacted as late as mid 1994 in Germany. [Directives of the European Union do not automatically become part of the law in each member state. They rather have to be implemented by each state. When, however, a member state does not implement a particular directive, it is liable for damages caused by the non-implementation.]  </field>

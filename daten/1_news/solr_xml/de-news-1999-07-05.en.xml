<field name="text">Federal Chancellor Schroeder said after a meeting of the SPD party committee that he did not consider it impossible to abandon nuclear power earlier than scheduled. The Greens do not want power plants to supply the system for more than 25 years, whereas the SPD demands a remaining operating time of 35 years. According to Schroeder, wishes may always be expressed, but they would have to be measured by whether they are politically feasible. And the partner, who happens to be the energy industry, has a slightly different opinion than the Greens. A dismissal of nuclear power may only take place without any compensation. The chan cellor was, nevertheless, a little bit surprised that the Greens would conduct talks concerning a possible break-away from the government with none other than the energy industry. But chancellor Schroeder looked at this rather calmly.  </field>

<field name="text">A crisis talk on Wednesday is to clear up the conflict between SPD and Greens concerning the dismissal of nuclear power. However, the Greens referred to reports today claiming a possible compromise between SPD and Greens as "much ado about nothing." The chairperson of the Federal Commission on Nuclear Power Plant Safety, Christoph Matschie, said: "It will also be important what concessions are made by the nuclear power industry. Up to now, the 35-year operating time of nuclear power plants could be considered an offer only. That is not be sufficient. I believe we have to come up with operating times of less than 30 years." The spokesperson of the Greens executive board, Roestel, does not view the coalition to be under any immediate time pressure. It would not be necessary to arrive at a coalition internal solution during Wednesday's meeting.  </field>

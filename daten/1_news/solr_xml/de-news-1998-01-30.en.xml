<field name="text">Foreign Minister Kinkel said that he was for leaving no stone unturned in order to reach a solution of the Iraq-crisis, without resorting to force. Today Mr Kinkel was briefed by the UN's chief-inspector, Mr Butler, about intelligence the team had gathered as far as Iraq's weapons were concerned. Germany's position had not changed at all, even after Mr Butler's visit. After extensive talks with Mr Butler, Mr Kinkel said: "We share government's opinion that everything, and I mean absolutely everything, has to be tried to solve this recurring problem in the political and diplomatic arenas. If this won't work, we agree that military action cannot be ruled out." Mr Kinkel as well as Mr Butler appealed to President Saddam Hussein to avoid an unnecessary crisis, and grant the UN-inspectors access to his palaces. Mr Butler: "If they let us in and cooperate, we can get this job done and there wouldn't have to be a crisis." According to Mr Kinkel, so far Germany had not received any requests for assistance in case of a military operation, so speculations about an eventual involvement of German armed forces would remain exactly that - speculations.  </field>

<field name="text">The meeting of the EU's internal affairs and justice ministers came to an end at Birmingham. Main item on the agenda was an action-plan to fight illegal immigration into the EU by Kurds from Turkey and Iraq. Mr Kanther took the chance to emphasize once again how he thought they could best be be kept out. The EU should become a safety-union, according to Mr Kanther, and that should be final. Meaning: stop the immigrants before they reach the EU. Britain's minister Straw, who also presided the meeting, confirmed that the problem had a high priority with all member countries.  He also talked about humanitarian responsibilities though. Mr Kanther, however, had another axe to grind: in a European safety-union there was no leeway for a 'transit-attitude'. He wanted to make sure that refugees get registered immediately once they cross into the EU. If they do not have any ID, fingerprints should be used instead, and data would be stored in a centralised database. If German authorities were able to determine from where refugees entered the EU, using the above system, the refugees would have to return to these countries. At the beginning of the week the EU had already passed a remit fighting the influx of Kurds, and Mr Kanther thought that had been a big success. The UNHCR, the UN's organisation for helping refugees, said the EU was doing well trying to also look into what caused the exodus of Kurds, and possibly stabilising the regions concerned, though many refugees do not have a choice other than crossing the border illegally  </field>

<field name="text">The Schwartau company can take a deep breath now: the man trying to blackmail them into paying millions of marks in ransom-money by threatening to poison their groceries, is under lock and key. They will, however, have a hard time getting any damages out of the defendant: as he claimed himself, he did what he did because of an acute lack of the folding stuff.  The defendant is a 48-year old engineer from Ingolstadt, and police and the public prosecutor agree that he was the blackmailer. Last morning police from Luebeck and Bavaria impounded important evidence. Meanwhile the man admitted he had been the only one to plan and commit the crime. He was arrested and will be transferred to Luebeck for further interviews. Police had tracked him down after an attempt to hand over the ransom-money, after investigations had also included Hungary and Austria. Based on what the defendant had said, police take it that there are no more spiked jars (of jam and marmalade) in the shops. Apart from that, they had never been a real health-risk to consumers, as there had been very little poison in the jars impounded in Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Hamburg.  </field>

<field name="text">Electricity supplier Neckarwerke wants to make 1150 staff redundant over the next years, but this would only happen through natural attrition, according to the company. This process might be sped up in case staff opted for early retirement or part-time work/retirement. The company resulted from last year's merger of Neckarwerke Esslingen and Technische Werke Stuttgart. At the time the new company had 5,400 staff.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Traffic Council asked for a total ban on alcohol for holders of learners' drivers-licences and young drivers. This could possibly lower the above-average number of accidents by 18- to 25-year old drivers. According to the Council, the 'probationary period' (restricted licence) for new drivers should also be raised from currently two to four years.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">In what may prove to be a case of arson, a fire in a commercial/residential building in this city in the Muensterland area killed 7 people, 4 of them children. Additionally, two occupants were seriously injured. The dead are thought to have been a Russian-German family. Police today took an Albanian man into custody. He had come forward as the person who first gave the alarm, but under examination got caught making inconsistent statements. The man is thought to have had a relationship with one of the victims, a young woman, until they broke it off just recently. The police are not saying that this matter had anything to do with the cause of the fire. Speculations of a possible family tragedy were in circulation throughout the day, but police refused to comment on the rumours, and did point out that the man in custody may have given contradictory information due to linguistic difficulties. The investigation continues on all fronts.  </field>

<field name="text">So-called cancer-healer Gerd Hamer (sp?) appearing before the Regional Court in Cologne, denied charges that he was at least partly responsible for the deaths of at least 3 patients. He also used the first day of hearings to make a serious indictment of orthodox medicine. The 62-year-old former doctor stands accused of denying necessary assistance as well as 13 offences against the Non-medical Practitioners' Law. Hamer is thought to have illegally treated dying and dead cancer patients, despite having had his medical license revoked in 1986. Still in custody, due to fears that he could flee the country, Hamer denies the Public Prosecution's charges. His defence counsel stated weeks ago that Hamer merely advised patients at seminars, but did not treat them. Three days of hearings have been provisionally planned for - in the largest court chamber in Cologne, due to the great interest expected in the case.  </field>

<field name="text">Holocaust victims from the Czech Republic and the United States want to sue the Federal Republic of Germany if no settlement is forthcoming in the matter of compensation for survivors from Eastern Europe. The announcement came from the lawyer in the negotiations between the German government and the Jewish Claim Conference. The Munich legal office is representing thousands of claimants against 16 European insurance companies and Swiss banks in this suit of Holocaust victims. Pay-outs by the German government have heretofore been overwhelmingly in Western countries, where those affected can receive individual pensions. In Eastern Europe, on the other hand, lump sums have been made to federal governments, where the money often dried up before reaching victims. A monthly pension of about DM 200 is currently on the table.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Finance Minister and CSU party leader Waigel has refuted the idea that he was tired of public office and would not run again in the Bundestag elections next year. Waigel thus addressed comments he had made on Bavarian radio. A spokesman for Waigel said that he was available for another term in office, if voters gave him the mandate. A spokesman for the party also felt that Waigel's earlier comments did not indicate that he had made up his mind to quit his office at the coming election.  </field>

<field name="text">Various associations and parties have given the university reforms recently agreed upon by federal and state negotiators marks ranging from good to unsatisfactory. The Conference of University Rectors, the highest administrative organ of the universities , welcomed the plan, but called for more money at the same time. The National Union of Employees and the Green Party criticized the abolishment of many democratic elements in the university constitution. Federal and state representatives had reached a basic agreement on shortening study programs, which, given current conditions, is also a problem of money. Many post-secondary institutions are too short on funds and personnel to be able to offer every student sufficient education opportunities.  </field>

<field name="text">There was a pile-up on the Wuerzburg-Fulda autobahn this morning. Several people were trapped in their vehicles. Early reports indicate that a transport truck lost control in heavy rain and hit the meridian, bounced off, and presumably came to rest in a driving lane. Seven further vehicles ran into the truck, most likely as a result of following too closely for safety given the wet conditions. At least 8 people were injured in the accident, some seriously. One victim had to be taken to hospital by helicopter. Damages are estimated at over DM 100,000.  </field>

<field name="text">Before journalists in Bonn, Chancellor Kohl emphasized today that halving the unemployment rate by the year 2000 remains a paramount goal of German Interior policy.  Mr. Kohl and DGB [National Trade Union Federation] chairman Mr. Schulte voiced principal interest in resuming summit talks between government, employers and unions.  Mr. Kohl said he is open for another try at the Chancellor's round table discussion which failed in 1996.  He cautioned, however, that such talks only make sense if none of the participating parties impose preconditions.  DGB chairman Mr. Schulte is less enthusiastic about these so-called Chancellor rounds, and suggests talks under DGB patronage, inviting government, opposition, and employers to meet with the DGB in spring in Berlin.  In the eyes of the Social Democrats, the high unemployment threatens social stability.  The economics spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group, Mr. Schwanhold, explained that Germany needs an initiative for more growth and employment.  </field>

<field name="text">At the CSU convention in Wildbad Kreuth, an internal dispute arose about how to proceed in the clash with the FDP.  The bone of contention is a statement made by Minister President Stoiber of Bavaria accusing the FDP of social heartlessness.  CSU Secretary General, Mr. Protzner, had distanced himself from that statement by saying it would not reflect the opinion of the CSU.  He continued that one could not use the FDP as scapegoat for all the unpopular sides of the austerity measures.  Stoiber's response spoke of a boomerang by Protzner and he maintained his criticism, saying the FDP has not always been guided by social justice when debating the topics of solidarity tax, lay-off protection, and store opening hours.  Stoiber added the FDP doesn't need to CSU Secretary General to defend itself.  The Bavarian Finance Minister, Mr. Huber, too, repeated his rebuke against the FDP.  </field>

<field name="text">The PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism, successor of former GDR socialist state party] chairman Mr. Bisky was informed about the Stasi [former GDR intelligence agency] engagement of party spokesman Mr. Harnisch.  Mr. Bisky told the newspaper "Berliner Tageszeitung" that in remaining faithful to his principles, he preferred consulting personally with Mr. Harnisch and viewing the matter in a differentiated way.  Until he sees the Harnisch file at the Gauck agency [agency archiving files of former Stasi members], there is no need for a rushed decision, Mr. Bisky said.  Yesterday, Mr. Harnisch had admitted to his engagement as so-called 'informal collaborator' [civil undercover agent].  He had spied on the GDR writers Ms. Marn and Ms. Lange-Mueller, Harnisch conceded in the newspaper.  Alliance 90/The Greens and the chairman of the Public Radio Council of the East German Radio Brandenburg have demanded Harnisch's resignation.  </field>

<field name="text">The IG Metall [union for metal industry, engineering and electronics] is no longer categorically opposed to the so-called 'Opening Clause' sought by employers.  [The 'Opening Clause' would allow individual companies to reach a wage agreement outside the traditional industry-wide collective bargaining system.]  The union's vice president, Mr. Riester, said in the newspaper "Stuttgarter Nachrichten" that exceptions can be justified to protect jobs, if both parties agree.  He added that such a special procedure could not be left to the companies to decide, since otherwise the industry-wide collective bargaining system would break down.  </field>

<field name="text">The car manufacturers General Motors and Volkswagen are trying to reach an out-of-court settlement in the conflict about the former executive Mr. Lopez. As Lopez's attorney said in Washington today, General Motors will drop the civil lawsuit against Mr. Lopez, filed in the U.S.  Accordingly, the damages suit against Volkswagen will be revoked.  It is said that in return, VW will cover attorney and legal fees accrued so far and has made a long-term pledge to buy parts from companies of the General Motors Corporation.  If the lawsuit had been successful, Volkswagen would have had to expect to pay several billion Dollars.  Although both corporations confirmed the negotiations, none of them wanted to comment on details.  Mr. Lopez had switched from General Motors to Volkswagen in 1993, and had quit the latter position in November 1996.  His former employer accuses him of having taken secret documents with him.  In Germany, the Public Prosecution at Darmstadt has indicted Mr. Lopez for industrial espionage.  </field>

<field name="text">This morning, the trial against the two alleged Reemtsma kidnapers, Mr. Richter and Mr. Kositsch, has begun before the Hamburg Regional Court. Heir of an industrial millionaire, Mr. Reemtsma had been abducted roughly 10 months ago and was released for a ransom of DM 30 million.  He stated in an interview he wants to follow the trial with an 'armed eye' as he put it and he sees with satisfaction that now the perpetrators bear the handcuffs and not he.  In court, Mr. Reemtsma does not only appear as witness but also as co-plaintiff.  On March 25, he had been knocked down in front of his house and was taken hostage for 33 days.  After a ransom of 30 million DM was paid, the kidnapers released the intellectual millionaire heir.  A few weeks later, Mr. Kositsch and Mr. Richter were arrested in the South of Spain.  Mr. Richter who is said to have handled telephone negotiations for the hand-over of the money is only accused as accomplice which carries a minimum penalty of two years.  Mr. Kositsch, whose criminal record already contained several armed robberies, faces at least five years of prison.  He is said to have been directly involved in the hand-over of the money packet, weighing 40kg, in Krefeld.  Thomas Drach, the alleged mastermind of the gang is still fugitive. A large part of the ransom is also still missing.  </field>

<field name="text">According to newspaper reports, the third stage of the Health Care System reform might not go into effect in its present form.  The newspapers "Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung" and "Westfaelische Rundschau" wrote that the draft by Minister of Health Seehofer shall be defused.  Patients would not be required to pay a larger share of the cost of medications, hospital care, rehabilitation measures, and dental services even if the insurers increase their premiums.  According to the news articles, the coalition thinks that Seehofer's proposal would punish the patients rather than the insurance companies.  At the beginning of the election campaign, this could hardly be in the interest of Chancellor Kohl, the papers said.  </field>

<field name="text">In his traditional New Year Message Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called on the German people to make more saving and reform efforts. He also challenged the citizens to be prepared for radical changes. Germans could not continue in the same way as they have so far without putting their future at risk. According to Chancellor Kohl the new challenges are international competition, restructuring of the welfare state, and European unification. Germany will remain a rich country, but only if the right decisions are made. Kohl stressed the importance of more effort to keep up with increasingly stronger international competition. Germany will keep its position as an export economy only if the necessary changes are implemented. The Chancellor said: "We save to secure a good future for our country and future generations." As the most important next steps Kohl mentioned the planned tax reform and the restructuring of the welfare state.  </field>

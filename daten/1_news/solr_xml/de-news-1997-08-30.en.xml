<field name="text">The German Association of Unions (DGB) expects that the number of unemployed will rise to five million this coming winter. DGB chair Ms. Engelen-Kefer told the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG that this was going to be especially likely in the case of prolonged cold spells. Ms. Engelen-Kefer added that currently there were no political measures in place that would bring about a reversal in trends in the employment market. She called the federal government to raise its subsidies to the Federal Labor Office by 4 billion Marks in the coming year, in order to reduce unemployment among youths, as well as long-term unemployment. Ms. Engelen-Kefer suggested that the extra money be used to finance continuing education, training for career changes, and adjustment aids.  </field>

<field name="text">Minister of Employment Bluem is determined to implement the pension reform this coming year, even if he will have to do it alone. In an interview with the DEUTSCHLANDRADIO, Bluem said that he was still hoping to reach consensus with the opposition and that he was prepared to fight for a compromise. He defended the proposal to implement the reform early, in 1998. Bluem expects that this will mean no raise in pensions for those retired in West Germany for one year. The CDU member further called for a restructuring and re-financing of the current pension system. For example, he promoted the idea of stabilizing pension plan payments with federal subsidies. These subsidies could be financed with a one per-cent increase in the value-added tax, said Bluem.  </field>

<field name="text">FDP member Mr. Hirsch has voiced criticism of the agreement of coalition and SPD concerning the so-called great surveillance attack. In an interview with the WESTDEUTSCHE ALLEGEMEINE ZEITUNG he noted that the measures planned were insufficient. At the same time, he was concerned that an audio supervision of living quarters would primarily affect those uninvolved in any illegal actions. Mr. Hirsch stressed that in his opinion the surveillance attack was just the beginning and that everything else would tumble in its wake. Further criticism of the compromise was voiced by Buendnis 90/The Greens. Minister of Justice Schmidt-Jortzig said yesterday that the catalog of measures might be signed into law before the end of this year. However, this could only happen if changes were made to the constitution which limited the inviolability of personal homes.  </field>

<field name="text">During the next ten years, hundreds of satellites are scheduled to be brought into space. The largest telecommunications, computer, and electronics companies are working to secure their portion of the world-wide communications market. These companies are expecting rising demands especially in Asia. China and India, for example, are known to have under-developed communications industries. The minister of the postal service now hopes to do his part in making sure that German companies benefit from the rising demand for telecommunications in these countries. During one last major business trip before the dissolution of the ministry of the postal service, Minister Wolfgang Boetsch, heading a large delegation of economists, is flying to India today. Mr. Boetsch hopes to contribute to opening to German companies a telecommunications market that is currently considered one of the least developed in the world but rated by experts to have an especially high growth potential. Mr. Boetsch plans to promote a further opening of the market in India's capital New Delhi, which is one condition that needs to be fulfilled before foreign companies, such as German ones, can enter it. In the following, Mr. Boetsch will visit "India's Silicon Valley" Bangalor. The delegation will return to Germany on Thursday.  </field>

<field name="text">The higher postal rates, which will go into effect on Monday, are not legally founded notes the Association of Postal Customers. Association chair Mr. Huebner said that the raises in postage should never have been passed. Mr. Huebner explained that the raises were to be considered illegal since the letter division of the postal service closed with net wins of 1.7 billion Marks last year. The higher rates would mean an additional 1.6 billion Mark gain. Mr. Huebner added that the postal service needed the extra money to make up for losses in its parcel post division. On Monday, the postage for a standard letter, among others, will go up to 1.10 Marks.  </field>

<field name="text">Experts of the European Union believe that significantly more British beef than previously assumed is being sold in Europe.

<field name="text">In the opinion of the Environmental Protection Agency of Germany, excessive farming is one of the causes of the recent catastrophic floods. The agency's vice president said in Potsdam that the industrial production methods of modern agriculture were wearing out the soil. He explained that healthy soil was constantly being loosened by earth worms and other small animals, which allowed rain water to be absorbed by the ground. Pesticides and heavy farming equipment destroy these organisms and bring about an extreme compression of the soil. Rivers cannot take up all rain water running off the fields, especially since wetlands were increasingly being built over.  </field>

<field name="text">The union of police officers demands that parents be held responsible for crimes committed by their children more so than they have been until now. Union Chair Lutz said in an interview with BILD AM SONNTAG that if children committed robbery, arson, or murder, their parents had to be held responsible for these violations. Mr. Lutz explained that under current law, parents are only guilty of neglecting their educational responsibility in such cases, while they should really be guilty of actively aiding these crimes. Mr. Lutz called to add this definition of parental responsibility to the criminal code. On the other hand, he considered committing criminal youths to prisons or youth reformatory institutions the wrong approach to solving the problem. Mr. Lutz suggested to give the children a greater chance of rectification, instead.  </field>

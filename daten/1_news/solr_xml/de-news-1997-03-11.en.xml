<field name="text">Chancellor Helmut Kohl has cancelled talks with the mining and energy union scheduled for this afternoon because of continuing miners' protests. Secretary of the Chancellor's Office Friedrich Bohl announced after a coalition meeting this morning that the government will not negotiate in an atmosphere of protests. After the announcement some hundred miners entered the buffer-zone around parliament where any protest is prohibited but left quickly. Later, miners followed the request of union leader Berger at a rally that afternoon to return home for the time being. It remains unclear what will happen on Thursday.  </field>

<field name="text">The CDU/CSU faction has today approved of Health Minister Horst Seehofer's plans for the health reform in spite of all criticism. Starting July, the patient's share of all medicament and health service costs will increase by DM5 or 5 percent. The increase will return about DM5 billion for the public health insurances. Patient shares will continue to rise automatically every two years by a small amount. However, each time the public health insurances increase the income-indexed contributions the share increase will be substantial. Two changes are not controversial: Physicians will be allowed to share jobs, and patients who consult several physicians about the same illness will have to pay for the second opinion. Health insurances may introduce primary-physician systems where the family physician is paid extra for co-ordinating his patient's treatment by specialists. The draft by Health Minister Seehofer must be presented to the Bundestag by 21 March.  </field>

<field name="text">In her annual report Parliamentary Ombudsman for the Armed Forces Claire Marienfeld deplores supply bottlenecks in the Bundeswehr. Ms. Marienfeld warned against a two-tier army. Only quick-response units for foreign deployment are sufficiently supplied. All other units complained about a lack of material and spare parts. In some units more than half the vehicles are not ready for immediate use. Soldiers called the situation desolate. Ms. Marienfeld mentioned an example where firework was used as training ammunition. One education officer had a hand torn off when he ignited a self-made explosive. About 6300 soldiers, 400 more than last year, complained to the ombudsman. Complaints about abuse and undue roughness increased. There was also a slight increase of drug abuse. This year, however, there were no casualties. Right-extremist tendencies in the Bundeswehr were no topic, as only 56 soldiers had been suspected.  </field>

<field name="text">The Transrapid Planning Group and environmental protection association BUND have presented two opposing expert opinions on the energy budget of the controversial high-speed train Transrapid that is propelled at 400 km/h by magnetic levitation technology. Both studies, however, agree that the Transrapid will harm the environment more than Inter-City Express high-speed trains on conventional tracks. The study by BUND declared Transrapid a veritable waste of energy. According to the study the Transrapid consumes three times as much energy as the ICE. The study assumes the Transrapid travels at maximum speed which is 200 km/h faster than the train. The study by the Planning Group shows a completely different picture. According to their study the Transrapid only uses 15 Watt-hours more than the ICE when the comparison is based on power consumption per passenger and kilometre. Again, the Planning Group pointed out that the levitation train harms the environment less than cars or planes while being faster than converntional trains. The environmentalists demanded that the "train of madness" must be stopped now.  </field>

<field name="text">A lorry carrying more than 200 heifers had an accident in the Black Forest near Hinterzarten. 120 of the 240 calves were killed in the accident. More than half the surviving animals had to be killed on site to relieve them from their pains. The accident happened at around 7am. It took firemen and helping farmers more than 2 hours to get dead and life heifers out of the three-storey semi-truck. Police assume that due to high speed the transport missed a steep down-slope curve into the Hoellental [Devil=B4s Valley] , skidded, and capsized.  </field>

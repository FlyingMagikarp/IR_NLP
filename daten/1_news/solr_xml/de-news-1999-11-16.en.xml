<field name="text">An expert committee including members of the Red-Green coalition has criticized the health reform of Health Minister Andrea Fischer. The reform would lead to a two-class health care. In their counter-opinion the experts propose to increase competition among the public health insurers and to lift the restrictions for the certification of physicians by the public health insurers. At the same time, the experts call on the politicians to admit that an optimal health care can no longer be supported by public health insurers.  </field>

<field name="text">Five experts of economics, also known as the Five Wise Men, predict 2.7 percent economic growth next year. In spite of the growth, unemployment will not decline significantly. The experts presented their fall report today. Just under 220'000 fewer unemployed people than last year -this the experts called good luck rather than merit, because fewer young people entered the job market due to the low birth rate [following the baby boom in the 60s]. The Five Wise Men welcomed Finance Minster Hans Eichel's austerity package but considered his plans for a reform of enterprise taxes beside the point. The experts also criticized the government's pension policy and the government's refusal to make the job market more flexible. They called the Alliance for Employment a foreign body in the German political system. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stressed that the austerity policy would continue and conceded that more reforms were needed. "This outlook on the job market is not enough for us" Schroeder said. The Council of German Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) welcomed the pressure that the expert opinion puts on politician to continue the reform process, but the council remarked that the 2.7% growth were not sure, yet.  </field>

<field name="text">British mobile phone carrier Vodafone is determined to take over Mannesmann in a hostile bid. The company announced that it would offer to the shareholders an exchange rate for the shares until Monday. Apparently, there will be no cash transactions. Vodafone head Chris Gent said a hostile takeover was possible if the Mannesmann executive board was not ready to give in within the next days. As a precaution, Vodafone guarantees to keep the jobs at Mannesmann. The Mannesmann location in Duesseldorf would continue to play a major role and would not be abandoned. Mannesmann, however, sues a British investment bank that consults both Vodafone and Mannesmann.  </field>

<field name="text">The former NS prisoners-of-war are insisting on a compensation of over 10 million DM.  Their lawyer Witti declared that the current government offer of 7 million in totally unacceptable. The government representative Lambsdorff is sceptical on whether a new round of negotiations will lead to an agreement. The talks may fail unless both sides are prepared to compromise. Since yesterday the government is offering 3 million DM for the negotiations, one million DM more than previously. The German industry has hitherto committed itself to paying 4 million DM. German lawyers of the victims are demanding that all together more than 10 million DM must be paid. Representatives of the Jewish World Congress made it clear that it is not just about material demands, but about the German side taking a clear position on general moral responsibility for crimes committed during the NS period.  </field>

<field name="text">In the dispute about the take-over of power supply systems, the Federal Supreme Court has found in favour of the districts.The energy suppliers won't be allowed to raise the price for their communal power supply systems so high that a change over would be economically pointless for the district. In the previous case the Kaufering district near Munchen filed a complaint against the Bavarian Lech power station. The municipality wanted tp pay 2 million DM for the power supply system, but the current supplier is demanding 8.5 million DM. Now the provincial high court in Munchen must decide on a reasonable price.  </field>

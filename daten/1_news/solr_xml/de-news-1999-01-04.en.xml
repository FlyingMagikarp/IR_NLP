<field name="text">The European exchange markets welcomed the Euro with high gains. Traders registered a plus of 4% at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the first trading day of the Euro. Other stock exchanges in Europe showed a similar picture.  While the US government welcomed the strength of the Euro, its reaction was reserved. If the economy were to grow in Europe, American companies would also benefit from it. It would not accept doubts that the Euro could replace the dollar as the number one reserve currency. Even the US Secretary of Finance hinted that the Euro is a currency just like any other currency. The United States would have to remember its own strengths for which it would need a solid economic policy.  At its onset, the Euro registered gains in international currency trading.  The new Euro currency registered with $1.1850 on the stock exchange in Tokyo, which is 1.5% above the value set at the fixing in Brussels on New Year's Evening. In Singapore, Asia's second largest currency trading place, the new European currency also climbed to 1.18%.  </field>

<field name="text">The CDU suffered sharp criticism due to its proposed petition against dual citizenship. According to the coalition and the FDP, this increases the danger of an anti-foreigner sentiment. FDP leader Gerhardt accused his CDU counterpart Schaeuble of no longer being up-to-date. Wolfgang Schaeuble ignored this criticism today. Schaeuble said he considered it to be a mistake which could not be made up if the dual citizenship were to be realized based on Red-Green plans without corrections. In contrast to the government, the CDU demanded tests, such as language tests or tests for constitutional loyalty, which applicants for German citizenship would have to pass first.  </field>

Schorlemmer stated that the judiciary had examined the responsibilities for 10 years and had sentenced only a fraction of the accused to rela- tively minor prison sentences.

<field name="text">The State Premier of Sachsen-Anhalt, Hoepner, demanded a closing law for GDR injustice. The SPD politican wrote in an article for "Berliner Zei- tung" that such a law will be passed during the current legislative period. He is interested in integration, not in a final end. An integra- tion in Germany could not succeed if complete groups of former citizens of the GDR were to be put at a disadvantage over a longer period of time or permanently or if they were stigmatized.

<field name="text">The Bavarian Parliament and the State Government celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Bavarian constitution with a ceremony at Ludwig-Maximilians University. State Premier Stoiber warned in his speech that in a unified Europe the German states might be reduced to administrative entities. The Bavarian constitution is a good example how federalism can work, Stoiber said. This gave politicians the courage and power to act independently in research, art and culture. State Parliament President Boehm also acknowledged the women and men who have worked out the constitution. As real democrats, they provided a model for the defense of right, justice and human dignity. Boehm also stressed that the Bavarians gave themselves their own constitution. On December 1, 1946 a wide majority of citizens voted for the constitution. Since the war, the constitution has been changed six times; for example, guarantee of the freedom of broadcast, environmental protection as goal of the state, and local referendum have been added.  </field>

<field name="text">The SPD lost 5% since the last state election, getting 44.4% of the vote.  The CDU gained almost 7%, and has 45.5% of the vote, which resulted in a change of government.  Peter "young savage" Mueller, the CDU challenger, came out the victor, having promised 60,000 new jobs, and economic support for the middle and working classes.  Another factor in the CDU's favor was Saarland's uncharacteristically low voter turnout of only about 70%.  The SPD couldn't mobilize its core constituency and there alone lost more than 5% of the vote.  Tears and long faces characterized the Greens, who were voted out completely.  The Greens, like some parts of the SPD, blame this on federal politics.  The Liberals also did not make it in, but still have cause to celebrate.  Though they won no seat in the state parliament, but a change of government has come about.  Thus, only 2 parties will be represented in Saarland's parliament, with the CDU possessing just one seat more than the SPD.  </field>

<field name="text">The SPD in Brandenburg lost almost 15% of the vote, and with it the absolute majority; ending up with 39.3% of the electoral votes.  The CDU gained almost 8%, receiving 26.6%.  Gains were also reported by PDS, now at 23.3% In Brandenburg's new Parliament, the Social Democrats will have to find a coalition partner. According to premier Manfred Stolpe, they will sound out both the CDU and the PDS.  Stolpe said he refuses to lead a tolerated minority government, as the loss of votes was too steep.  Early  analysis indicates that the SPD lost more than 30,000 votes to the CDU and more than 40,000 to the PDS. Representatives of all parties expressed their dismay over the right-extremist party DVU's gaining entrance into parliament.  Stolpe called this a personal defeat.  The SPD also lost a few direct mandates, one of them in the very state capital of Potsdam, where the PDS's top candidate and party leader Lothar Bisky replaced the incumbent SPD candidate.  </field>

<doc><field name="date">1999-09-06</field><field name="title">SPD lost because core constituents stayed away </field>
<field name="text">Initial analysis tends to show that the SPD's losses in both Sarre state and Brandenburg may be attributed to the voting behavior of core constituents.  In Sarre, the SPD's losses were especially high in large cities, lower income residential areas, and among low wage-earners, according to Infratest.  calculations A decisive factor for the defeat was the disappointment core constituents felt about red-green politics on the federal level, which made them stay at home in droves.  The CDU won whereever the SPD lost. The union has again turned attractive for younger Sarre voters.  The SPD's Brandenburg debacle was due to a voter shift of 19% of their former constituents, who changed over to either CDU, PDS, or even the extreme right-wing DVU. Many habitual SPD voters just staid away. The SPD reaped  tow figure losses in lower income and in rural areas. Right-wing DVU gained votes from SPD among blue collar workers and unemployed persons.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Chancellor Schroeder wants to keep the federal government locked into the economy package despite the SPD's electoral losses. The SPD boss said last night that there was no reason to deviate from the "plan for the future".  The program was necessary, accurate, and would therefore be carried through.  The CDU left clear after their victories that they want to make use of their increased strength in the Bundesrat [second chamber] introduce important changes into the program.  Saarbruecken's premier designate Mueller, called the plans unacceptable, because they passed on the costs to the states.  In particular, he called on the governing coalition to abandon their plans for changes in retirement pay.  </field>

<field name="text">Franz Muentefering will be the SPD's General Secretary, after being unanimously nominated to the post by the SPD council.

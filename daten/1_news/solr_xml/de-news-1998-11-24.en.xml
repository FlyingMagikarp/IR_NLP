<field name="text">The criticism for tax reform continues within the ruling Social-Democratic Party (SPD) of the government's plans. Reinhard Hoeppner, State Premier of Saxony-Anhalt, was the first Eastern head of an SPD-led state to react negatively. In a newspaper interview, Hoeppner warned against detrimental effects that the ecological tax would have for the "new states" of the former East Germany. He said they should be granted a special status. Hoeppner pointed out that the prices for electricity in the East are currently higher than in the West. Hoeppner has also got reservations about the plans to change the regulations involving so-called "casual jobs." Gerhard Glogowski, State Premier of Lower Saxony, demanded revisions for casual jobs and child benefits. The State Premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Wolfgang Clement, has rejected the criticism of his plans again. In order to create more jobs, he has reiterated his call for tax relief for small and mid-sized businesses. The SPD's parliamentary party leader, Peter Struck, assured the states that they will be consulted about the law reforms. Struck said he takes fears of the revenue decreases seriously.  </field>

<field name="text">The trade unions welcomed the reforms planned by the federal government for "casual jobs" (paying less than DM 620 per month). The trade unions for the construction, agriculture, and environment industries (BAU) and the mining, chemical, and energy industries (BCE) spoke of a first step towards easing the burden on welfare coffers. The head of the mining union, Hubertus Schmoldt, renewed his criticism of the planned energy tax. However, he believes that it would endanger jobs. Schmoldt called upon those involved in the employment alliance saying that the government strives to create a consensus to be reached. There should be no prerequisites for the talks between social partners and the government beginning with next month. The head of the construction union IG-Bau, Klaus Wiesehuegel, deemed the planned solution for casual jobs in need of improvement, but believes that fundamentally it is a good one. According to him, it fulfils the primary demand of his union to include the people who work only few hours and therefore earn little in the social security system. It was right that employees would decide for themselves whether or not they wanted to acquire the right for pension benefits by making additional payments.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping has reinforced the fact that there will be no changes in the fundamental questions of security and foreign policies under the new government. The Social-Democrat/Green coalition does not want to go its own way in the alliance, said Scharping in reaction to American criticism of a proposal made by Federal Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. Fischer suggested a more defensive orientation for NATO without the option of a nuclear first-strike. Yesterday evening, the US Defence Secretary William Cohen said that the concept of a first-strike was an integral component of the strategical plans of the US.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Court of Auditors deplored the waste of billions of DM in tax money. In Bonn, the Court's president, Hedda von Wedel, presented the annual report for 1998 in which the cost increase in defence projects and new ship building, among others, were blamed. In many cases, the responsible budget committee in the Bundestag had not been notified. The Court of Auditors suggested that in  more than 90 areas savings can be done, including administration and use of real estate. Many expenditures could have been avoided by better planning, better organisation, and a little common sense. The Court of Audit cited examples: for the new construction of the Federal Labour Court in Erfurt, more than 2 million DM was to be spent for installing sun protection devices in areas that hardly get any sun. The army spent 500 million DM on forklifts that do not fit through the doors of the majority of halls. In general, the auditors criticised the fact that in most cases no alternatives had been considered and the cost and use were not examined before processing a purchase.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the magazine "Sternï¿½, the fire on the freighter "Pallas" w will end up costing the federal government and coastal states a few million DM. The magazine reported in its latest issue that the Dutch company Weismueller itself paid 70,000 DM per day to remove the oil from the freighter stranded near Amrum. More than 500 tons of oil are still on board. According to the estimation of experts, it will take at least 3 more weeks before all the oil has been pumped out.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt, the criminal offences in East-Brandenburg have increased by more than 0.5 times compared with the year before. It is not only the "Sieg-Heil" shouting and the wearing of Nazi symbols; what mainly increased is the number of violence acts against foreigners. In the last two years all the attacks of the right-winged extremists on foreigners were solved. The administrative jurisdiction in Brandenburg also registered an increase of drug crimes especially in schools and nightclubs.  </field>

<field name="text">According to a decision of the European Court of Justice, the public authorities in South Tyrol have to talk to German and Austrian tourists in German, if they demand it. The minority rights for the German-speaking citizens are valid not only for South Tyroliennes with the Italian citizenship. The German Court of Justice decided, for example, that the police officers have to talk in German when inspecting a car with German tourists.  </field>

<field name="text">Telekom head Ron Sommer was elected "word blender" of the year. This was made public by the "Society for the protection of the German language" ("Verein zur Wahrung der deutschen Sprache"). Sommer has introduced new terms like "Sun- und Moonshinetarife, City-, Free- und German Calls" into the telephone business. He has therefore not done a big favour to the German language. In the eulogy for the Telecom manager they talk about a "spineless adaptation to the modern pseudo-cosmopolitan try-to-impress-drivel". The society has got 3,200 members and is therefore the biggest society in Germany involved in the maintaining linguistic standards.  </field></doc></add>

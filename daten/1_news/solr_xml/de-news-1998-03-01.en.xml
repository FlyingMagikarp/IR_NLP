This was announced by the party's Secretary General, Mr. Muentefehring, in Bonn. Mr. Schroeder will be officially nominated as the candidate on Monday. Gerhard Schroeder himself stated on the subject of his candidature: "Although the committees will not decide until tomorrow, I assume that the result of the election is such that I will be nominated. Oscar Lafontaine has called me and asked if he can propose my nomination with my consent. Of course I gave my consent, that is what was to be expected. And therefore things will proceed with great unity tomorrow."  </field>

<field name="text">Today's election in Lower Saxony has long been regarded as a test of public opinion for the parliamentary election in September. The result of the election also determines if State Premier Gerhard Schroeder will be nominated by his party as candidate for the chancellorship. Mr. Schroeder has announced that he will only be a candidate if he does not lose more than 2 percent of the vote compared to the result of the 1994 election. The SPD received 44.3 percent of the votes in Lower Saxony in 1994. The Christian Democrats' candidate, Christian Wulff, together with the FDP, is aiming for a change of government. In the last state elections, the CDU received 36.4 percent of the votes, while the Liberals missed the 5 percent mark which would have guaranteed them a place in the state parliament.  </field></doc></add>

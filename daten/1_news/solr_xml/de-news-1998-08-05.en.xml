<field name="text">Four persons are still assumed to be trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building in Berlin.  The bodies of two women and a 13 year old boy who was home alone at the time of the accident have been recovered so far.  The leaders of the rescue operation feel there is a definite possibility that people could have survived inside pockets in the rubble.  So far however, despite the use of bloodhounds no new signs of life have been located.  The work is extremely difficult, as multi-ton chunks of rubble constantly threaten to shift or slide.  On top of that, the rescuers have no information on where in the building people were at the time of the accident.  The collapse was caused by a gas explosion.  In late afternoon, a further body was found.  According to the Fire Chief's report, it was a 70 year old occupant of the building.  This raises the total number of victims to four.  Police, Fire, and technical aid organizations have 600 aid workers on the scene, who are clearing away the collapsed building stone by stone.  The recovery work may last through till tomorrow.  </field>

<field name="text">The Minister of Health has criticized the fact that there are great differences in the drug policies of the different federal states.  The CDU politician accused SPD governed states of sabotaging the successes of the federal government in the area of drug policy, reducing those successes to nothing.  Cities such as Hamburg and Frankfurt have offended by setting up "safe rooms" where addicts can take their drugs, which is clearly against the narcotics laws.  Because of this, argues Seehofer, the Minister of Justice needs to ensure that criminal prosecutions in Germany are standardized.  </field>

<field name="text">The Ministry of Health is apparently considering improved controls over so-called "substitution programs" for drug addicts.  Only specially trained doctors would be permitted to prescribe methadone for example.  Additionally, methadone programs would be required provide qualified psychiatric and psychosocial care.  An investigation of around 2,200 prescriptions from such programs in Munich and the surrounding region turned up numerous irregularities, said Seehofer.  </field>

<field name="text">Owing to growth in sales, the German trade and craft industries can create approximately 50,000 jobs this year.  President of the Central Association, Phillip, said the mild economic recovery in Germany must not be allowed to cover up the fact that the industry urgently needs relief in the form of tax reform and a restructuring of the social support system.  The economic crisis in eastern Germany, however, has meant that this year fewer apprentices can be taken on.  </field>

<field name="text">Experts estimate the number of unemployed has continued to rise in July, up by approximately 80,000 to 4,150,000.  Reasons for the rise include company holidays and the last opportunities for giving notice before the end of the quarter, as well as the end of the instructional year.  The IFO Institute for Economic Research in Munich also issued a forecast for the labor market today.  According to their report, unemployment is unlikely to sink below 4 million.  The Institute says a turning point has been reached in the western states, but not however in the east.  As for economic growth, the researchers expect an increase of 2.7% for 1998.  </field>

<field name="text">Saxony-Anhalt's premier Hoeppner would not rule out further talks with the CDU party about forming a coalition government. Last night, when interviewed by German state television ARD, he said that the CDU had to be willing to co-operate with all the other parties in parliament in the battle against the right-wing German People's Party (DVU). Yesterday talks between the SPD and the CDU came to an end shortly after they had started. The CDU had been against the SPD's idea to co-operate with the PDS when fighting the DVU. The PDS re-iterated that they would tolerate an SPD-led minority government - without any preconditions.  </field>

<field name="text">The first nationwide referendum supporting the labelling of genetically-engineered foodstuffs has failed. During the past two weeks only about half of the required number of signatures had been collected in Bavaria. More than 50 different groups had initiated the referendum. Bavaria's CSU passed a law covering the same issue, which, according to the opposition, did not have enough bite.  </field>

<field name="text">The number of petitions received by parliament (Bundestag) went up by about 12% in 1997, compared to last year, bringing it to 20,066. Main bones of contention had been pension and social policy issues. Almost 40% of the petitions were handled by the Ministry of Labour.  The Ministry of Health's share increased, too, mainly due to severe cuts in the health sector.  </field>

<field name="text">Baden-Wuerttemberg's finance minister Mayer-Vorfelder has come under increasing pressure when it was leaked that he had taken money for holding a speech at the LBank. The SPD asked premier Teufel to dismiss him. The Greens stated that this minister was not acceptable. Tonight Mr Mayer-Vorfelder declared that he had subsequently donated the fee - 5000 marks - to a hospital. Premier Teufel was critical of the matter and said he did not think it was appropriate for ministers who were members of a state supervisory board to take money for speeches.That's what he had told Mr Mayer-Vorfelder. He would make sure it would not happen again.  </field></doc></add>

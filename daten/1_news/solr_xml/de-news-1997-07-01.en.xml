The hostage-taker left the building with the wife of Luebeck prosecutor Heinrich Wilde. He forced his hostage to get into the driver's seat of the car that he had demanded for his flight. The man took the seat behind his hostage. Shortly after the car had started moving a flash grenade exploded next to the hostage-taker. While he was still blinded and stunned, police opened the doors, rescued the hostage, and overpowered the criminal.  </field>

No information was available on the subject. Stoiber had caused tensions between Bonn and Munich by repeatedly demanding to delay the introduction of the common currency Euro if there was an emergency situation.  </field>

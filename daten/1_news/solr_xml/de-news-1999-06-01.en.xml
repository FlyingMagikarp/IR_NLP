<field name="text">Federal health minister Ms. Fischer apologized for her recent pronouncements that led to escalation of discontent among physicians. In the inaugural meeting of the 102nd annual meeting of the German medical association, Fischer said she was willing to talk thins over and assured physicians that their opinions were to have considerable weight in working out Bonn's remodeling plans for the area. Her apology came forth in response to demands made by Dr. Vilmar, the association's chairman, who had taken offence with accusations levelled by Fischer to the extent that physicians were prescribing unnecessary pharmaceuticals on purpose, in order to provoke ballooning costs. In his openung speech, Vilmar repeated his controversial contention that the planned "Health Reform 2000" would establish a "socially bearable early demise quota", as an underbudgeted health system would lead to excluding certain age and illness groups. The red/green plan would lead to the collapse of an efficient system of international renown, said Vilmar. He will not stand for re-election after 21 years in office. Before the meeting, the social security entities AOK and VdK had warned affiliated doctors against misng patients in order to strengthen their political arguments. Their threatened action of refusing to prescribe pharmaceuticals or to treat patients was plainly illegal.  </field>

<field name="text">In answer to the Belgian dioxine scandal, the federal government plans to lower a EU-wide ban against export of Belgian chicken meat and eggs. Germany would, if need be, lower the ban on her own, said agriculture minister Funke. Belgium's ministry of health meanwhile extended the ban on wholesale distribution to egg-containing products such as noodles, desserts, ice-cream and mayonnaise. Poducers who have been found unaffected will be allowed to sell shortly. Investigations ar under way to find out whether swine were also fed dioxine infected food from Belgium. Government investigators found eggs and chicken legs form Belgium on the Baden-Wuerttemberg market. All these products had been voluntarily pulled off the market by retailers, according to the ministry of agriculture. Food specimens are now being tested for exposure to dioxine.  </field>

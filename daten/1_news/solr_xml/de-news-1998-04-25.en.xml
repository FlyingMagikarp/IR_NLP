<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl appealed to his party to get into battle-mode, and also asked both CDU and CSU parties to close ranks. After their infighting during the past days, there was a need for peace and quiet now. On his party's state congress in North-Rhine/Westphalia, Mr Kohl laid into his political opponents.  The CSU wants to get out of the trough as far as voters' opinions were concerned; that's the message this congress wanted to get across, only 1 day out of the state elections in Saxony/Anhalt. There must be an end to infighting. Chancellor Kohl, the main speaker at the congress, delivered a pep-talk to his party asking them to make good use of the remaining five months 'till the elections to turn around voters. We bet on a victory, not just getting there. And Mr Kohl dug a bit deeper when referring to his opponent of the SPD, Mr Gerhard Schroeder. On balance he did miserably as premier of Lower Saxony, his announcements had remained empty promises. According to the media he was the shiny knight on the golden sloop, but in reality he had failed abominably as far as the re-unification of the two Germanies and the common European currency were concerned. Prior to Mr Kohl, state leader of the party and federal labour minister Norbert Bluem had delivered a fiery and trend-setting speech, to the delight of the more than 600 delegates. Red-Green (coalitions) would be dangerous for Germany; Dusseldorf's example should never be ported to Bonn.  North-Rhine/Westphalia - capital Dusseldorf - has had a Red-Green coalition government for a while, with no shortage of ups and downs either.  </field>

<field name="text">It's all still speculation, but rumours abound. Who will get which job in case the SPD wins the elections? Several newspapers claim to be in the know, though party officials' lips are sealed.  Don't count your chickens before they are hatched - that's what their leaders keep repeating these days. The German original comes across a tad more belligerent: 'Don't share the bear's hide before you've caught him'. According to the newspaper WELT AM SONNTAG, head of the party Oskar Lafontaine will get a super-ministry (economics and finance). Mr Scharping will remain head of the parliamentary group. According to the news magazine DER SPIEGEL, deputy head of the metal-workers' union Walter Riester will get the labour ministry, succeeding Norbert Bluem. And Mr Riester allegedly already has said yes. Mr Schroeder is also to have two women run traditional ministries, namely the ministry for internal affairs and the ministry of justice. Even if they have to form a coalition government, the SPD is hell-bent on getting the ministries for internal affairs, defence, economics and finance. Today the SPD neither confirmed nor denied any of that, but someone else did: management consultant Roland Berger, Munich, who allegedly was short-listed for the ministry of economics, said that he would not serve as minister under Mr Schroeder. He had his problems with the SPD's manifesto, and apart from that, he would vote for the CSU in the next elections.  </field>

<field name="text">Neither the Bundesbank nor the Ministry of Finance want to comment on an article in the tabloid BILD alleging huge profits of the central bank. They referred to the bank's meeting on May 14. Allegedly the bank had made a profit of 23.5 billion marks in 1997, 7 billions of which had been paid into Mr Waigel's federal consolidated account. The profit was made by a more up-to-date valuation of dollar reserves the bank holds. So far the central bankers had been prudent and used an exchange rate of 1.35 marks to the dollar. Currently one dollar is worth 1.80 marks.  </field>

<field name="text">The police officers' union asked for more restrictions and better security for hardened criminals in penitentiaries. Deputy union leader Freiberg criticised that making life in jail more pleasant would mainly be done to re-socialise inmates, when interviewed by the newspaper NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG. Protecting the general public would be less important. Mr Freiberg said that this could play into the hands of right-wing radicals. According to head of the union Lutz, the number of violent and drug offences in Germany keeps rising. In an interview with the tabloid BILD, he stated that last year the number of the above offences had risen by 3.9%, to reach almost 187,000. Leaders of the pack were Saxony-Anhalt and Hamburg with rates of 10.7 and 10.2%  </field>

<field name="text">Members of the infamous Chaos-Computer-Club (CCC) have cracked the code for the telephone card of Mannesmann Mobilfunk (a cellular phone company), according to a report by DER SPIEGEL. They were able to access secret data due to inadequate encryption codes. They were able to copy the cards for the D2 network and make telephone calls on other customers' bills. D2-Mannesmann confirmed that their telephone cards could theoretically be copied; they claimed, however, that the risk of damage is about the same as a cellular phone card and the password being stolen at the same time.  </field>

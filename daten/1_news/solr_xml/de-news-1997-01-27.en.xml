<field name="text">Henning Voscherau, mayor of Hamburg, has urged Bundestag to permit distribution of heroin for experimentation. It is estimated that in Hamburg alone there are currently 10,000 mostly young heroin addicts. Although almost every other junkie is under medical treatment, the remaining addicts cannot be reached through conventional programs such as the distribution of methadone. The mayor also considers the nationwide trend of increasing numbers of drug-related deaths and people passing on to harder narcotics alarming. Heroin prescriptions by doctors might bring a stop to the vicious circle of addiction, crime and impoverization. Voscherau referred to Switzerland, where heroin has already been dealt out to addicts. This has resulted in rapid health improvement among junkies. Voscherau appealed therefore to the government to change the narcotics law accordingly. Voscherau stated that the drug war has been lost a long time ago.  </field>

<field name="text">Bundestag and Bundesrat honored the victims of National Socialism. 52 years ago today the prisoners were freed from the Auschwitz concentration camp. The former mayor of Hamburg Klaus von Dohnanyi warned not to ignore the past. He stated that "We cannot let it happen that here the Nazi reign and the Holocaust will be locked away in buildings constructed from the names of the culprits and the numbers of the victims. Every school that dedicates itself to only one victim's fate from those years, districts and villages that give back a name and a human face to only one of the tortured anonymous, can do more to maintain our memory and thoughts than many hours of dull history classes." The head of the parliament  Rita Suessmuth urged the German people to remember the crimes of the Nazi era for the sake of a better future.  </field>

<field name="text">An autopsy will be performed on the 41-year-old North Frisian who presumably died of the Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. Her relatives have approved the procedure. The results of the examination will only be available in several weeks, the Minister of Health in Schleswig-Holstein, Moser, stated. The pathological examinations are supervised by experts from the University of Goettingen and may take several weeks. Afterwards, the public will be informed on the circumstances of the woman's death. Moser could not confirm claims that she had spent an extended period of time in Great Britain in the past. Moser also said that there were no indications hinting at a new form of theCreutzfeld-Jakob disease. It is suspected that the new variant, which also infects young people and is said to proceed much faster than the one only occuring in older people, is caused by the same factors that cause the bovine disease BSE. According to minister Moser, there is no need for political action even if the North Frisian woman died of a new form of this rare disease.  </field>

<field name="text">The planned fusion of broadcasting companies in the southwest will cause no job losses, according to an estimate by State Premier Erwin Teufel. Although it might lead to cuts due to technical progress in the media, Teufel said on Westdeutscher Rundfunk, he did not believe that the planned fusion of Sueddeutscher Rundfunk and Suedwestfunk would lead to job cuts. Teufel believes that jobs could be cut in the administration, but because of the widening of the program range, new jobs would be created. Opposing this view, the CDU party leader in the Stuttgart state parliament, Guenther Oettinger (sp?) had stated in December that the fusion would bring along a considerable reduction of jobs. According to him, the new station would have to get along with less than 3.500 jobs and thus the current total employee figure of 4.270 would be decreased by over 800 employees. With the saved money, programsshould be improved.  </field>

<field name="text">Frankfurt am Main. There has been no sign of the blackmailers of the food manufacturing company Thomy, and the Frankfurt police have received no further demands from them. Last night, more than 60,000 people rang the special telephone line which has been set up for inquiries. In their original communication, the blackmailers claimed to have placed poisoned products in over 50 supermarkets throughout the whole of Germany. Nestle has replaced all its products but none yet investigated showed any sign of anything unusual. The police have announced that it could take up to two days before all the goods have been investigated and have called on people to return all Thomy and Nestle products unopened to the shops where they bought them. Nestle has been being blackmailed for over a year, and poison has been found in its products several times.  </field>

<field name="text">According to 'Monitor,' a programme on the ARD television network, fresh fish is often infested with nematodes, a type of threadworm; almost all sea fish can carry the larvae. These parasites enter the fish though their foodstuffs and mostly inhabit the gastro-intestinal tract, but they sometimes settle into the fish's muscles. If infested fish are not cooked properly, the nematodes can survive the cooking process and present a health hazard to the consumer. There are two species of worm which are especially dangerous for humans, the herring worm and the cod worm, and research commissioned for the 'Monitor' programme has shown that both types of worm are very common in fish. There were reports of worm larvae infestation in fish just ten years ago, and Germany the European Union issued new guidelines on the preparation of fish and tightened regulations on inspection as a result.  </field>

<field name="text">Manfred Stolpe, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg, has called for more help to be given to the victims of the recent flooding in the region around the Oder river. In a government statement, Stolpe said that, although the total cost of the damage is not yet certain, it is already clear that the costs cannot be covered by the state of Brandenburg and the donations which have been given up till now. It is thus important, Stolpe continued, that Chancellor Kohl should declare the help needed to cope with the flooding to be a national duty.  </field>

<field name="text">Brandenburg's state parliament has agreed unanimously on a special 'Oder-programme' to help those affected by the recent flooding. According to a first estimate, 170 houses and 177,000 hectares of agricultural land were flooded and 950 firms were damaged. The exact extent of the damages is not yet calculable, but it is certain to exceed the hundreds of millions which have already been promised by the national government and the European Union. The state cabinet in Potsdam is hoping to organise immediate help and reconstruction justly and quickly and with a minimum of bureaucracy. An account set up by the state for donations has already received DM 12 million. Prime Minister Stolpe has promised those affected that they will receive special help in the next few weeks.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bundesbank (German National Bank) has predicted that national, state and regional government will receive even less tax revenues than in previous years. The bank, based in Frankfurt, expects tax income to be worse than the pessimistic predictions made in May, when it was thought that public finances would be DM 18 billion short. The Bundesbank also expects tax revenue to fall in the next three years and has recommended that taxation be reformed so that income tax is substantially reduced and taxes on consumption are increased. The tax reform should be transparent and should plug tax loopholes. The Federal Ministry of Finance, however, is planning to keep to the figures it set out in May. The SPD, meanwhile, has repeated its criticism of the governments plans for the tax reform, which would not be affordable under these circumstances.  </field>

<field name="text">according to pension insurance companies, the chief danger for the pension system is the constant increase in unemployment. Ruhland, the president of the organisation of insurers, has emphasised the fact that the low employment ratio is endangering the pension system, alongside the increase in average age of the population. In connection with this, Ruhland criticised employers who have caused the pension companies to pay out an additional DM 20 billion each year because there have been so many early retirements. Ruhland has called for the pension reform to be brought forward to 1998 as this will take the pressure of the pension companies and will remove the danger that pensioners will suffer from having no yearly increase in their pensions.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the trade union Bauen, Agrar, Umwelt ('Construction, Agriculture, Environment'), at most fifteen per cent of the foreign construction workers employed on German building sites are paid the minimum wage. Wieshuegel, the president of the union IG-Bau, said in an interview with the newspaper 'Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung' that there are virtually no big building sites in Germany where there is absolutely no form of illegal work going on, so it wouldn't surprise him if illegally low pay rates were being paid on construction projects financed by the government. Wiesehuegel called for harder punishments for those responsible.  </field>

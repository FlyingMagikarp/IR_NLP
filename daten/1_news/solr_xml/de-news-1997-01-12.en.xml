<field name="text">The Chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Schaeuble, opposes extending store opening hours to include Sundays. In a newspaper interview he said, the Commandment of Sunday demands that stores be closed on Sundays. Schaeuble referred to the Creation story and said that something that has been in effect for thousands of years almost everywhere, does not have to be thrown away all of a sudden. Plus, only two months after the heated discussion about closing hours, the subject should not be brought up again. The CDU politician disagrees with German Minister of Economics Rexrodt, who just recently advocated to open stores on Sundays.  </field>

<field name="text">In the opinion of the Chairman of the Central Committee of Jews in Germany, Bubis, the Jewish Communities should not separate itself from society. Bubis who is celebrating his 70th birthday today, said that he is trying to change something within the communities. But one can not forget that there are holocaust survivors who are still subconsciously afraid. On the other hand, the Jews can not remain in a ghetto, they have to be part of society as a whole. That includes being politically and socially active. Numerous politicians acknowledged Bubis' engagement in Germany in congratulatory messages. German Chancellor Kohl stressed that Bubis returned in spite of the pain experienced during the National Socialist dictatorship, and participated in the building of the Federal Republic of Germany. Foreign Minister Kinkel called Bubis a persistent reminder and watchman against forgetting. German President Herzog said, people like Bubis are responsible for the fact that Germany can last as a democracy. Bubis has integrated the Jewish community strong and visibly into society and its daily routine.  </field>

<field name="text">Legal politics speaker of Alliance 90/The Greens, Beck, opposes the idea of withdrawing the status of organization from Scientology. With demands like that, the organization is driven into illegality, Beck warned today in Bonn. Also, it gives them an excuse for portraying themselves as victims and makes more people sympathetic. Alliance 90/The Greens think it is more effective to fight Scientology with constitutional means and information of the public. Tax collectors should investigate the financial activities of the organization. The proposal to withdraw the status of an organization from Scientology came yesterday from FDP Secretary General Westerwelle.  </field>

<field name="text">Alliance 90/The Greens have renewed their request to the Social Democratic Party to come up with a clear election statement by the spring of 1998 at the latest. In an interview with the radio station "SDR", Managing Director of the parliamentary group, Schulz, said, voters have to be clear early, whether to decide for a red-green alliance or the Christian Democratic Union. Black-green discussions don't make sense at this time, Schulz said.

<field name="text">Berlin Mayor Diepgen is pushing for a special conference between federal, state and local governments to reorganize their financial relationships. Diepgen also demanded a quick decision about future tax policy in an interview with the radio station "Deutschlandfunk". Making more and more new propositions, only undermines the sense of security, which is not helpful for Germany as a business location. The CDU politician rejected speculations about a Grand Coalition on the federal level as absurd. What is happening in some parties left of the Bonn governing coalition is a sign of complete insecurity. The strength of the PDS shows according to Diepgen that Germany still faces a number of problems in growing together. Attempts to reduce the differences between East and West were not successful, and parties used confrontation between East and West strategically.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government is apparently considering delaying the introduction of the unified European currency, the euro, by one year. According to a news report, the green light for monetary union is only supposed to come in the year 2000. Nevertheless, the changeover to the new currency is still supposed to be completed by 2002. Hence, the schedule would be shortened from 3 years to 2. Within Germany's governing coalition, it is being said that it would be better to stop the countdown for a year than to start with a weak currency. The suggestion must not be made by Germany, some say, however, but rather by another European partner, such as France.  </field>

<field name="text">The coalition continues to grapple for a way out of the current budget crisis today. The problem is how to fill a gap in the tens of billions of Marks over this year and next. A round of talks between leading member of the CDU/CSU and the FDP this morning ended without tangible results. The two parties still disagree on what course to follow; as they diplomatically put it following today's discussion, they are still in the middle of negotiations. Even though today's talk, at least the third episode of tax-related rancour within the coalition, failed to achieve a settlement, the representatives of both sides in the Bundestag are going to debate tax reforms in a special sitting, even though, officially at least, no concrete suggestion is on the table yet. The SPD called on the government to be honest on the subject of lowering the Solidarity Supplement, as the promised reduction amounted to DM 7.5 billion, which the country could not afford just now. However, the FDP rejects any delaying of the reduction.  </field>

<field name="text">The Opposition has accused the Government of failure in the fight against unemployment during a Bundestag debate on European policies. SPD representative Wieczorek-Zeul said her party would not vote in favour of the new EU treaty without a set of common European employment policies. Foreign Minister Kinkel had earlier, in an official government statement, rejected delaying the introduction of the euro. He also placed conditions on the Government's approval of a European employment programme. Kinkel said that EU-wide employment programmes must not come to be; Germany's government does not want any work programmes which are far removed from its citizens, and also cannot be financed. Instead, Kinkel wants individual national programmes to be better coordinated than heretofore; if that were to be the case, his government could approve a chapter on employment in the EU treaty. In his speech, Kinkel said that Germany and France were rowing in the same direction as far as Europe was concerned, the new French government was staying the course, and the success of the EU summit depended, as so often, on Germany and France not breaking ranks. He added that if any problems did arise at the summit, the federal government would clear them up at the future German-French summit in Poitier. Speaking in the direction of the SPD, Kinkel warned against criticizing monetary union, saying that whoever came out in favour of delaying it was hurting Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">The economic committee of the CDU has demanded that less money be spent on the unemployed, pensioners, and public employees. The chairman of the organization, Muhrmann (sp?), said that the goal of lowering the state's financial activity to 46 percent of GDP by the year 2000 must be adhered to despite lower-than-expected tax revenues. He rejected the idea of tax hikes, saying it was unacceptable to advance only the 'taking' provisions of the planned tax reform to 1998. Meanwhile, tax reform talks within the governing coalition have ended without agreement.  </field>

<field name="text">The central association of German trades, as well as the CDU's own economic committee flatly reject tax increases as a means of filling budgetary gaps, supporting the position of the FDP, and rejecting suggestions from the CDU/CSU that the 'burdensome' provisions of the great tax reform be implemented ahead of schedule, next year. The opponents of that suggestion say that if the tax increases are implemented early, then the tax breaks must be as well. They are also calling for continued savings measures, especially in the area of social services. The trades association supports the early sale of federal Telekom shares. It is calling on the SPD not to block the estimated DM 12 billion in savings any longer in the Bundesrat. The trades are also distancing themselves from the lowering of secondary wage costs through an eco-tax, as the SPD is demanding. As to the euro, they have adopted the chancellor's position: it must come on schedule, or it will never come.  </field>

<field name="text">Businessman Hans-Peter Daimler has been sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment in the Lucona trial, following almost 5 years of hearing evidence. The judgement from the Regional Court in Kiel reads that the 62-year-old is guilty of six counts of being an accessory to murder and of attempted murder; Daimler and his Viennese friend Udo Proksch are responsible for the sinking of the Dutch freighter Lucona 20 years ago. In that sinking, 6 of the 12-member crew died. The court also found Daimler guilty of attempted insurance fraud; he and Proksch had falsely declared the cargo to be uranium, and had insured it for about DM 33 million.  </field>

<field name="text">Germany will help expand local passenger service on the rails with over DM 22 billion between 1998 and 2003. Federal and state transportation ministers came to this agreement at a conference in Munich. With the agreement, talk of the German Railway abandoning large numbers of uneconomical lines has been ended. Plans to that effect had come to light in recent weeks. The transportation ministers wanted to have all the facts, and had asked departing railway boss, Hans Duerr, and his July 1 replacement, Johannes Ludewig, to meet with them. Following the meetings, the chairman of the transportation ministers' conference, Peter Fischer of Lower Saxony, said that the ministers had been happy to hear from the executive chairman of the German Railway Co. that no mass programme to eliminate lines was intended. Rather, the railway would continue to shut down only a few lines on which fewer than 10 trains a day ran and for which the usual assessment procedure included at look at economicalness.  </field>

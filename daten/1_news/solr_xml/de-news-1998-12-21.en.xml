<field name="text">In Moscow, the Ruhrgas AG signed contracts for the acquisition (at first a share of 2.5%) of the Russian energy company Gasprom. The company from Essen bought the package of shares (total value 1.1 million DEM) already on Sunday. According to its leader Spaet, Ruhrgas plans to increase its share of Gasprom up to 4%. But he said nothing more about long-term plans for a higher investment in the Russian company. They also agreed upon, that Gasprom will supply the Ruhrgas AG with a third of its consumption until the year 2030. Since some time, the Russian Government had planned to sell some of its investments. The collapse of the Ruble and a lack of prospective purchasers caused several postponements of this transaction.  </field>

<field name="text">The Minister of Building and Construction, Muentefering, warns that the costs of the Government removal to Berlin might exceed the plan. He said in Berlin, that in fact he is sure about the observance of the budget of 20 billion DEM. But nobody could give a guarantee on this, because there will be an unknown number of commuters between Bonn and Berlin. The completion of the new building of the Chancellor's Office can be expected by the end of the year 2000. That will be half a year behind the schedule. Until then, Chancellor Schroeder and his staff can use the former State Council building. Muentefering said, that the removal will be mostly in time and that the schedule will work mostly fine.  </field>

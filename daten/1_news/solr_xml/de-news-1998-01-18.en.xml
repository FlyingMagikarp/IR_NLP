<field name="text">After the decision of the North Rhine-Westphalian Greens to continue the coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Parliamentary Party Leader of the Greens has pointed out the consequences on the federal level. Mr Fischer warned the SPD on the "ARD" TV station that the national election at the end of September will be a decision about a new energy policy. He said that the Greens could not support using brown coal as fuel for electricity. North Rhine-Westphalia's State Premier Rau stressed that the SPD will continue to support the mining of brown coal. In spite of disagreement in this matter, the North Rhine-Westphalian Green Party decided yesterday during a special party convention to continue the coalition with the SPD.  </field>

<field name="text">The Parliamentary Leader of the Union Parties in the Bundestag, Mr. Schaeuble, has revised earlier statements and now opposes a grand coalition (CDU/CSU and SPD). On the "Deutschlandfunk" radio station, Mr. Schaeuble rejected even a short-term collaboration to solve pressing national problems. He said that the present governing coalition has to instead fight for victory in the coming state parliament elections to break the SPD's majority in the Bundesrat [upper house of parliament] before the Bundestag [lower house of parliament] elections in September. A week ago, Mr. Schaeuble had not excluded a grand coalition in an interview with the magazine "Spiegel". He said that in the September election, the Union's goal is to attract more than 40 percent of the votes.  Union parties have to fight for themselves to reach that goal and that they Union cannot give away any votes.  </field>

Rudolf Scharping, the Parliamentary Group Leader of the Social Democrats in the Bundestag, was expected in Hannover as well.

<field name="text">Mr. Scholz, the legal expert of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has warned against tightening non-smoker protection laws. He referred to plans to punish violations of non-smoker protection laws with 5000 mark fines. Mr. Scholz told the weekly paper "Bild am Sonntag" that the goal should be an efficient government with less bureaucracy and laws. Militant non-smokers' plans have exactly the opposite effect. Mr. Lutz, the President of the Police Union, agrees with this and said that the police have more important things to do than to deal with illegal smokers.  </field>

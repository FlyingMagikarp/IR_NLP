<field name="text">The parliamentary leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Hermann Otto Solms, said to Deutschlandfunk radio today that he anticipated that the talks on tax reforms beginning tomorrow between the governing coalition (CDU, CSU and FDP) and the Social Democrats would yield positive results within a relatively short period of time. He continued that no-one could shirk the responsibility of finding ways of improving the unemployment situation and that the FDP were more than open for far-reaching tax relief, starting as early as next year. Mr Solms also said that the basic structure of the governing coalition's original tax reform proposals had to be preserved, even after compromises with the SPD. This would mean both lowering income tax on a broad scale while radically reducing tax concessions. The bottom line would have to amount to tax relief of around 30 billion marks, otherwise the tax reforms would not be accepted. Theo Waigel, the Federal Minister of Finance, stressed the necessity of taking painful measures, saying that lower tax rates needed to be counterbalanced by radically reducing tax concessions. In an interview with the Sunday newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine", Mr Waigel referred to extra pay for night work and public holiday shifts as a case in point. At the same time, Mr Waigel reaffirmed that increasing Value Added Tax by one percent would be sufficient to counterbalance the reduction of income tax revenue. In an interview with the Bild newspaper, Rudolf Sharping, the parliamentary leader of the SPD, ruled out additional taxation of extra pay for night work and shifts on Sundays and public holidays. In addition, he said that the Social Democrats would insist on significantly increasing the taxation of higher income groups.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federation of German Trade Unions (DGB) has appealed to the coalition parties in Bonn to maintain parity in health insurance contributions. The DGB issued a statement today in Duesseldorf saying that the current discussions regarding health-care contributions would do away with the idea of a "social partnership". (The coalition plans that future health insurance contribution increases should be covered by the employee portion alone; the employers' portion would remain at a fixed rate.) The employee wing of the Christian Democratic Party are also against the coalition's plans in this regard, and have stated that they will only support proposed tax, pension and health-care reforms if social insurance contributions were shared between employer and employee.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Minister for Families, Claudia Nolte, has called for lower pension contributions for parents. The Sunday edition of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine" newspaper reports that Ms Nolte says that the planned reforms should include financial concessions for young families and mature mothers bringing up children. Ms Nolte suggested a moderate redistribution from childless contributors to contributors with families, with a specified abatement in the pension contribution per child.  </field>

<field name="text">A railway in Brandenburg has been subject to an attack. According to the Potsdam Police, unknown perpetrators threw grab hooks up onto the electrical wiring, causing an oncoming train to damage the wires. Rail traffic had to be diverted for several hours.

Several Castor transports are planned for the beginning of March to transport nuclear waste to interim storage at Gorleben in Lower Saxony.  </field>

<field name="text">There have been several incidents in connection with a rally against ultra-right violence yesterday in Magdeburg. Police have made around 80 preliminary arrests, including several teenagers who face prosecution, said a police spokesman. Twenty two police officers were injured during these incidents. The number of demonstrators injured is not known. The demonstrations were to mark the death of a punker about two weeks ago. A right-extremist youth who is currently being detained has confessed to the murder. There were also several violent incidents in Aschaffenburg after a peaceful rally. Around 500 rioters threw stones at windows and damaged motor cars. Police have arrested several persons. The rally, attended by about 1,500 people, was in protest against an event organised by the National Democratic Party (a neonazi party) which was later cancelled.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">Squabbles flared up once again after Germany's telecommunications market was opened to competition as of yesterday. German Telekom, the former government monopoly, wanted customers to pay a fee if they switched to the competition. One of the competitors accused Telekom of abusing a monopoly and stifling competition. Telekom wanted to charge subscribers a one-off fee if they permanently used a competitor's services, and they also wanted a fee if a current customer asked for a 'portable' phone-number. Telekom needs the consent of the regulator, before they can go ahead and enforce these fees. The regulator, Mr Klaus-Dieter Scheuerle, favoured additional fees, given the technical resources required for the above services. The question would still be: who should pay, and how much. Maybe the competing telephone company should foot the bill, not the (maverick) customer. According to Telekom spokesperson Ulrich Lissek, competitors did not want to pay their share, so individual customers would get charged. A portable phone-number would be the equivalent of a personalised number-plate for a car, so there should be a fee of 53 marks for that service. Mr Scheuerle, however, was against, and said that this would be a required service: "We want (more) competition, so it is important customers can keep their phone-numbers. I can't see why fledgling competition should be crushed by charging fees that simply are too high, and are not based on costs."  The SPD also asked Telekom to meet market-forces by offering attractive deals, rather than trying to crush the competition.  Two competitors, namely Arcor and otelo, filed complaints about Telekom's plans with the regulator. Both claimed that the fees were over the top, and unusual in other countries.  As was leaked last night, German Telekom will have to show the regulator precise costings before they can consider charging the above fees. Mr Scheuerle confirmed that Telekom's plans would be looked at. Until he has made a decision on the matter, no fees can be charged.  </field>

<field name="text">A few days before their Stuttgart meeting on 6 January, head of the FDP Gerhardt confirmed that he wanted to stay in power, and also opposed changes to party policy. Speaking out against left-wingers he declined to draw a line between good and bad liberals in his party. Apart from less tax, the FDP wanted to emphasise education and European policies in their election campaign (for the upcoming federal elections). Head of the Baden-Wuerttemberg branch of the party Doering also wanted to stop infighting, so the party could close ranks and concentrate on the election campaigns.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the tabloid BILD, the CSU wants to give the fight against crime higher priority, and they will put it in writing in a remit to be passed at their next meeting at Wildbad Kreuth (in the Bavarian alps). This would go beyond anything passed by federal government so far. Amongst other measures, CSU law-experts Geis and Zeitelmann wanted to extend police-surveillance, the so-called Schleierfahndung (surveillance by casting a wide net or, more gently, veil). Police then should be allowed to stop any motorists on any road, even without suspicions having been raised previously. The Secret Service should also be used in the fight against organised crime, and crown witnesses' testimony should be used more often. As a deterrent, minimum security prisons should be abolished, so inmates' bodily presence in jail would be required. And there should also be a taxpayer-funded victim's advocate, who would assist victims of severe crimes.  </field>

<field name="text">Interior Minister Kanther asked Italy to do something about their (external) border-control, after the recent lot of Kurdish refugees who had entered Italy. Italy had to pull their weight, just like Bonn, to make sure the Schengen Accord worked, according to an interview on radio by Mr Kanther. Illegal immigrants who were not caught in either Italy or Greece, would try to get into Europe by crossing other borders. It wasn't on that Germany tried to do other European member states' jobs. Case in point: yesterday another ship carrying hundreds of refugees had been impounded off the Italian coast.  </field>

<field name="text">Last year, 25% less ethnic Germans immigrated to Germany compared to 1996's numbers, according to Commissioner Waffenschmidt, and he expected 1998's numbers to be even lower, as government's measures were beginning to bite. The number of people seeking asylum also dropped by 10%, according to the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU.  </field>

<field name="text">The approximately 1,000 inhabitants of the township of Deutzen, near Leipzig, returned to their homes, after they had been evacuated because of toxic fumes. The authorities stated that there was no health-risk any more, according to air samples analysed by them. Burning plastic refuse in a neighbouring recycling-centre had released cyanide, hydrochloric acid (HCl) and dioxines.  </field></doc></add>

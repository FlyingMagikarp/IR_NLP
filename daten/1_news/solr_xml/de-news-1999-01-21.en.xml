<field name="text">A controversy has developed in the lower house of parliament over the plans of the federal government to withdraw from use of nuclear power and reprocessing of nuclear waste.  In one of the Union faction's Aktuellen Stunde Environment Minister Tritten defended the plans of the Red-Green coalition.  The end of reprocessing presents no strain on the relationships to Great Britain and France. Tritten stressed that no compensation payments have to be made to the French company in La Hague or the British one in Sellafield.  Similarly, Minister of Economics Mueller stated that the three-way storage arrangement is a relic from the olden times.  The CDU representative Grill accused the federal government of destroying 100,000 jobs through its policies.  The FPD politician Rexrodt stated the ban on reprocessing will lead to substantial demands for compensation.  Tritten's plans will cause damage to the European plants.  In the afternoon the administration and the opposition debated the expert council's yearly report over economic development.  Finance Minister Lafontaine defended his consumer goods market directed policies.  The Union's Deputy Director Maerz criticized that Lafontaine's approach will lead to inflation and further unemployment.  </field>

<field name="text">NATO General Secretary Solana has asked the Yugoslavian government to accept the G8-foreign ministers' peace proposals. Mr Solana said in a radio interview that if Mr Milosevic had one bit of common sense left, he would accept the peace plan; otherwise he would be forced to accept it, by military and political measures. At the same time Mr Solana declared that he was for an extension and reform of NATO. Responsibilities would have to be reallocated between North America and Europe, in view of new challenges. There already is agreement to the G8 peace plans by the Albanian government as well as the underground Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). In Tirana a government spokesperson said that the plan would basically cover what his country had wanted. A representative of the KLA welcomed any plan leading to stability. In Washington US President Clinton explained his ideas for an international peace corps, as proposed by the G8, meaning that it should be similar to the SFOR-corps currently in Bosnia (where NATO is in charge, but Russia, the Ukraine and other countries are taking part as well).  </field>

<field name="text">Today parliament  (Bundestag) passed amendments to the law on citizenship. 365 members of parliament voted for the so-called optional model, proposed by the coalition parties and the FDP. According to this model children born in Germany (to non-German citizens) will automatically be granted German citizenship, on top of their family's. Once they turn 23 years, they have to decide on one of them. Also, foreigners may apply for German citizenship after only 8 years' residence. In a fortnight the amendment will be discussed in the Upper House (Bundesrat) and is expected to be signed into law at the beginning of next year.  </field>

<field name="text">In April the number of registered unemployed went down to 4.145 millions, a 5-month low, viz. a decrease of more than 140,000 which caused the unemployment rate to drop from 11.1% to 10.7%. There was, and still is, a marked differential between East and West: East Germany's rate is 17.8%, whereas West Germany's rate is almost half of that (9%). President of the Federal Labour Office (Bundesanstalt fuer Arbeit) Jagoda said that this was mainly due to seasonal factors.  </field></doc></add>

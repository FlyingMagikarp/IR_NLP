<field name="text">Even after the urgent appeal for peace made by the United Nations to the parties involved in the Kosovo conflict the crisis continues to simmer in the troubled Serbian province. The political leadership of the Kosovo-Albanians rejected a call for dialogue issued by the Serbian government. Meanwhile in Germany the controversy over the deportation of Kosovo-Albanians has heated up. Prior to today's conference of interior ministers the federal government's commissioner for Balkan affairs, Dietmar Schleh, speaking on Bayerischer Rundfunk radio, pleaded for a united stance on the issue: "Actually, I am relatively confident that we will arrive at a joint approach. In any case, it can't be that one or the other side will not realize how important it is for everybody to tow the same line. If potential refugees see that there is disunity, then a wrong signal will be sent, a copycat effect will develop, we will then have to carry the Kosovo refugee problem to an even larger extent than is the case right now, and I believe that everybody involved will see this point and that we will eventually achieve a uniform position."  </field>

<field name="text">German car makers have clearly produced more vehicles compared to the same month last year. The association of the German motor vehicle industry reported an increase of 8%. This positive trend would probably lead to a slight increase in employment in the industry, the body said.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bavarian Greens will today for the first time award the "Green" and "Rusty Rail" prizes for especially good or specifically bad achievements in transport infrastructure policy. The CSU politician Adolf Heinrich von Arnim achieved positive recognition for, amongst others, his involvement in the "Pro Bahn" (pro rail) initiative. In contrast, first recipient of the "rusty" award was Interior Secretary of State Alfred Sauter (CSU). He was jointly responsible for a policy which emphasised the unrestrained expansion of the road network in Bavaria, the Greens reasoned.  </field>

<field name="text">It is a rocky road to becoming a non-smoker: there are only limited chances of success for those trying to quit smoking by resorting to nicotine substitutes. According to a British study there is in the long term a high rate of relapse. After nearly two years every fourth smoker who has, for example, used a nicotine spray, will again be dependent on tobacco. Overall, though, the success rate is still better than with people attempting to quit smoking without using any nicotine substitutes.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Minister for Science and Technology Ruettgers is convinced that there will be 500,000 fewer unemployed in Germany by next summer. In a radio interview the CDU politician declared that figures proved that the economic up-turn had arrived and that German industry was once again competitive. Ruettgers said that he reckoned with an extra 90,000 new jobs in the communication industry alone. In contrast, the president of the employers federation Hundt has qualified his announcement of the creation of 500,000 new jobs. He conceded that by the end of the day only 200,000 new employment opportunities would remain because jobs were continued to be abolished.  </field>

<field name="text">Fewer people in Germany have died of narcotic drug consumption in the last year compared to the previous year. The Federal Government's annual report lists 1501 fatalities, 211 fewer than in the preceding twelve months. A drastic increase, however, has been recorded with first-time users, this figure rising by almost 20% to 20,500 persons. The highest number of new narcotic drug users was registered in Bavaria. More than a fifth of all persons which came to the attention of police in relation to hard drugs came from the Free State. The demand for synthetic drugs continues. The greatest cause for concern for the Federal Government is that an increasing number of young people move to so-called happy pills. The drug report states that ecstasy remains the trendiest drug of the nineties. It was especially used by members of the middle class between the age of 16 and 25. The Federal Government's commissioner on drugs, Eduard Lintner, called on parents, teachers and clubs and associations to form an alliance of prevention. At the same time, however, the CSU politician continues to vehemently oppose the decriminalisation of the use of soft narcotic drugs like marijuana.  </field>

<field name="text">With the votes of its CSU majority the Bavarian state parliament's standing committee for education  passed a  motion demanding more direct responsibility for schools themselves: more co-operation between parents and teachers, improved qualifications of educators, and increased utilisation of the new media. Furthermore the CSU wants to commence a school pilot project in which the first and second levels of primary school are combined to a single two-year beginners level. The SPD, on the other hand, was unsuccessful with its motion which called for a concrete concept including a detailed financial plan for a broad reform of the school system.  </field>

<field name="text">During their meeting in Bonn the state finance ministers have rejected the demands of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg for a reformation of the fiscal equalisation arrangement currently in place  between the federal states. Sources said that the two states had stood isolated on the issue. Munich and Stuttgart demanded that the system of financial transfers between the states - set in law - be changed. In future the wealthier states should transfer less money to the financially poorer regions. The finance minister of the State of Hesse, Starzacher (SPD), also speaking on behalf of a contributing state, believed that the southern states had brought about their defeat themselves because they had by-passed reality in their planning: "In view of the dire financial situation I simply lack the imagination to see how the colleagues of the transfer receiving states can contribute to a compromise and then return to their state capitals and explain to their respective parliaments that they had displayed a state-supportive attitude and carried a compromise and that from next year there would be less money coming in." Bavaria's finance minister Huber continues to maintain that all states would have benefited from the proposed reform. But nobody had really made the effort to seriously study the different concepts: "The fact that every proposal has been slammed and rejected by the other states will leave us with no choice but to put the constitutional compliance of the current system to the test before the Federal Constitutional Court." A final attempt will be made during the conference of state premiers next week to convince a majority of states. That forum, however, is governed by the principle of unanimity, and - barring any political miracle - the dispute will eventually end up in Karlsruhe.  </field>

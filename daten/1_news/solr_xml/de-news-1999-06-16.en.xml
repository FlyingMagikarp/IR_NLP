<field name="text">Despite contrary warnings from NATO, thousands of Kosovar refugees in Albania and Macedonia continue to flood homeward. Representatives of the UN High Commission on Refugees and of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe spoke of chaos on the Kosovo border. At times, the line-ups of vehicles at the border crossings were kilometres long. At the same time, Serbian civilians are fleeing the province ï¿½ more than 30,000 so far, according to Red Cross estimates. The commander of the NATO peace force, British General Michael Jackson, appealed today to the Serbian minority not to flee as refugees, saying that KFOR would protect both groups. Meanwhile, in Helsinki, American Defence Minister William Cohen and his Russian counterpart Igor Sergeyev continue to discuss the roll of Russian forces within KFOR. The Interfax news agency is reporting that Russian government sources say that Moscow will not waver from its demand for a Russian sector in Kosovo, although it is willing to compromise on the details, as long as Russian interests are observed. Before today's meeting, Cohen again rejected the idea of a Russian sector, saying there could only be a single zone of responsibility; he did not elaborate. According to Deutschlandfunk radio information, two Russian battalions, about 1000 men, are to be deployed, along with German Army units, in the Prizren area. Both Russian units would be fit into the KFOR command structure, following policies developed in Bosnia. They would not comprise a formal part of the structure, but would in practice be under the German commander. in addition, a Russian liaison officer, attached to the KFOR command in Pristina, would apparently ensure communication among Moscow, NATO, and the German contingent.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, issuing a government policy declaration in the Bundestag, two days before the Global Economic Summit in Cologne, reaffirmed his commitment to continuing aid to Russia and to easing the debt burden on the Third World. He emphasized, however, that resources did not currently allow Germany to completely release developing countries from their debts. Schroeder said that the goals of globalization included economic competitiveness, social justice, and democratic rule of law. He also described the coming meeting of the leading industrial nations and Russia as the beginning of a new economic upswing. Schroeder also said that the German federal government would make its contribution to growth and employment through consolidating its budget. In the subsequent debate session, the Opposition criticized the policies of the SPD-Green coalition. CDU/CSU caucus leader Wolfgang Schaeuble accused the cabinet of being responsible for the weakness of the euro, through failed economic policies. The deputy leader of the FDP, Rainer Bruederle, said that there was a large gap between government claims and reality. The PDS accused Schroeder of falling back on the remedies of the conservatives for bringing change to German society.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Labour Minister Walter Riester plans to introduce a minimal federal old-age pension and obligatory supplementary private pension plans, according to government sources. At the same time, the existing policy of adjusting pension rates to the latest wage agreements in a retiree's industry will apparently be phased out over the next two years. Instead, pensions will be indexed to inflation, at around one percent annually. These reports have not been officially confirmed . However, Riester did say on ARD television that pensioners can expect cuts. He also announced that pension contributions would be further lowered, and stabilized at under 19 percent. The Greens reject the idea of obligatory private old-age security. The finance spokesman, for the Green party caucus, Klaus Mueller, said it would add to the contribution burden and put low-income earners at a disadvantage. The coalition will decide on the basics of pension reforms together with the savings and tax reform package, on June 30.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bundestag's culture committee has decided against State Minister Naumann's preferred plan for a Holocaust memorial in Berlin. The committee's chairman, Elke Leonhard, made the announcement in Bonn. Naumann had wanted the memorial to be supplemented by an information and documentation centre; the committee prefers that the memorial exclusively commemorate the murdered Jews. A majority on the committee agreed with a recommendation to present parliament with two choices for the memorial. The first would be a second proposal by the architect originally commissioned, Eisenmann. The other was suggested by a theologian named Schroeder, and consists of the phrase "Thou shalt not kill" repeated in many languages.  </field>

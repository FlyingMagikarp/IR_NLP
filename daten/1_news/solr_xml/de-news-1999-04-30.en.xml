<field name="text">The CDU-governed states' initiative to shoot down the laws on the so-called McJobs and nominally independent contract work in the Upper House (Bundesrat) was a flop. A remit by the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg failed to attract a majority of votes. State Premier Teufel called the new regulations devastating as far as economic policies were concerned, whereas State Premier Clement of North-Rhine/Westphalia admitted that there could be problems. If things did not work out, the laws would have to get amended. Before this debate the Upper House (Bundesrat) had agreed in principle to a reform of the law on citizenship.  </field>

<field name="text">The planned reform of the health sector is to guarantee good care for the patient and stable contributions, according to a first draft document. Mr Jordan said the main points would be strengthening the position of general practitioners, a reform of how hospitals would be paid for and a strict cap on expenses by health insurers. And apart from that there would be more emphasis on prevention and protection of patients. This draft is to be made into law at the end of June, to be tabled in parliament (Bundestag) by then. The Federal Association of Health Insurers (KBV) criticised that the proposals would reinforce old, superseded structures. The German Society for Hospitals said that patients would be worse off.  </field>

<field name="text">One of the defendants accused of having caused grievous bodily harm to a French policeman in Nivel/France, has made a partial confession. At the Essen Regional Court a 24-year man from Essen admitted to having kicked the policeman twice, though he said he had not hit his head. Three of the four defendants said they were sorry. They have been accused of having almost killed the policeman following a soccer match. The public prosecutor wants them for attempted murder, having caused grievous bodily harm and sedition.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Court of Justice at Karlsruhe has ruled in principle that German courts of law may also rule on genocide committed outside Germany. The court ruled against the appeal of Bosnian Serb Jorgic. The 52-year old man had been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court. As leader of a paramilitary group he had killed a total of 30 Muslims in the Doboj district in 1992, according to the court. Defence claimed that this had been no genocide, and also that this was not Germany's business.  </field>

<field name="text">Mainly European items had been on the German-Polish summit meeting's agenda last Friday in Danzig. The items included the Kosovo crisis, co-operation with NATO and the extension of economical contacts, according to Poland's head of state Buzek. Chancellor Schroeder pleaded for making sure Polish forced labourers, who had to work in Germany during the Third Reich, should not be worse off than non-Polish Nazi victims, as far as payouts from the planned fund to be set up by German business were concerned. In the future these summit meetings are to take place every year, instead of every other year as in the past.  </field>

<field name="text">A majority of votes in the Upper House (Bundesrat) backed the coalition's proposal for the reform of the law on citizenship. In the future, children born (to foreign nationals) in Germany are to be granted German citizenship as well. They will have to decide which citizenship they want to keep once they turn 21. The new regulations are also to apply to children who are 10 years or less when the new regulations become law. This morning the Upper House (Bundesrat) had elected Hesse's State Premier Koch (CDU) as their president.  </field></doc></add>

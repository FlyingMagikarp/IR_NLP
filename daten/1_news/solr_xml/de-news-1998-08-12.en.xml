<field name="text">Despite extremely hot weather, at the moment there is no driving ban planned in Bavaria for vehicles without either a catalytic converter or low-pollution fuels. According to the Bavarian Environment Ministry, no decision will be made until the release of new data on ozone levels. The ozone alarm threshold is 240 micrograms per cubic metre of air. While such a ban has been in effect since 6 o'clock this morning in four of the federal states, police in Stuttgart and Frankfurt are reporting that traffic volumes have barely been affected.. High temperatures are expected to retain their hold on Germany until tomorrow, when the Federal Environment Office expects some relief, allowing the concentration of ozone also to fall to more acceptable levels.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal election campaign is heating up with the release today of the third and final part of the joint CDU-CSU campaign platform. In it, the sister parties assess their own past economic policies as - on the whole - positive, speak of a turn-around in the labour market, and confirm their plans for massive tax reforms. The central object of the tax reforms would be granting Germans 30 billion DM in tax relief. On the topic of policies concerning resident 'foreigners', CSU leader Theo Waigel presented the parties' platform: "Germany is cosmopolitan and hospitable, but it is not a land of immigration. Therefore, our platform openly favours: limitations on immigration, consistent repatriation of civil war refugees, further limitations on which family members immigrants can have follow them to Germany; furthermore, anyone abusing our hospitality must live with the consequences. We also do not want to allow double citizenship or automatic access to a German passport through simply being born within our borders. For anyone who wants to become a German, citizenship will be the last stage of integration, not the first. That means mastery of the German language, and allegiance to German culture, democratic order, and our laws." The platform document sets a clear direction for the Bundestag elections in September. According to the leadership of the sister parties, this autumn will see a major decision about the direction of German policies for the future. CDU and CSU claim that the current economic upswing confirms the efficacy of their reform policies. Federal Chancellor, and leader of the CDU, Helmut Kohl, is betting that confidence is spreading also among the voters. Kohl, in the names of both CDU and CSU, again rejected the notion of a Great Coalition with the SPD. The SPD accused CDU and CSU leaders of deceiving voters by claiming to be in the middle of the political spectrum, but being willing, if necessary, to accept toleration-support from the socialist PDS party.  </field>

<field name="text">Even after the decision of the Bavarian Administrative Court, that state's Internal Affairs Minister, Beckstein, plans to continue efforts to have the convicted 14-year-old deported. In an interview, the CSU politician said he would take every legally allowable means to have the boy removed from the country. Beckstein justified his position on the basis of fear of possible future victims of the boy's documented extreme aggressiveness. The Bavarian Administrative Court yesterday allowed an appeal against  a deportation order by the Munich Administrative Court. Mehmet and his parents can therefore remain in Germany for now.  </field>

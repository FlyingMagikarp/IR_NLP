<field name="text">The CSU makes its support of the pending tax legislation contingent upon a tax break of at least 40 billion marks.  Party chairman Stoiber made this very clear at the conclusion of the two-day executive meeting of the CSU in Wildbad Kreuth.  According to Stoiber, the CSU is aiming at a 25 per cent cut in corporate and personal income tax.  At the same time, he fended off concerns of the sister party CDU regarding such a large tax break.  In the CSU's philosophy, each citizen should assume more responsibility in their own health care and retirement planning.  In return, the CSU proposes a reduced mandatory pension contribution and tax relief for families with children.  </field>

<field name="text">In the scandal about improperly reported campaign donations to the CDU, former party chairman Helmut Kohl apparently has kept important files from his successor Wolfgang Schaeuble.  According to "Welt am Sonntag," Schaeuble has urged Kohl in a telephone conversation to surrender the documents in question.  The news report says that these files are the records of the interrogation of CDU tax consultant Weyrauch by the Augsburg Public Prosecutor.  Mr. Terlinden, CDU administrator and confidant of Kohl, had forwarded the files directly to Kohl and not to Schaeuble.  The latter learned about these documents only by chance, according to "Welt am Sonntag." In the meantime, the CDU has gained possession of the records, a spokesperson said.  Terlinden was suspended immediately.  At the party convention on December 13, the CDU is to present a progress report on uncovering the campaign donation affair.  In the words of former CDU Secretary General Geissler, the CDU leadership has to sever the ties to its long-standing former party chairman Kohl.  The era where the CDU is identified by a single person, must be gone forever, Geissler told the Berlin paper "BZ am Sonntag."  </field>

This means that, for example, the party officers such as the executive spokesperson or managing director could now also hold government offices.  This was traditionally prohibited by The Greens' party platform.  </field>

<field name="text">The gale Anatol has led to at least 20 deaths in northers and eastern Europe, in addition to millions of material damage.  Three women, among them two Germans, and two men have died in Denmark in storm-related car accidents. There were two casualties in Germany.  In northern Germany, winds were gusting to 190 kilometers per hour.  Trees were uprooted, power poles tipped over and street signs were ripped out.  Many homes were without power.  Some roads and rail lines were disrupted for hours, ferries didn't leave port. Radio broadcasts urged people to refrain from unnecessary driving and to stay at home.  By midnight, police units had been dispatched 1400 times in Schleswig-Holstein alone.  The damage runs into millions of marks.  In Hamburg, preparations were made early on for a spring tide, and large areas of the harbor were closed off.  The water level tapered off at 5.86 meters above normal, higher than at the devastating flood of 1962 when 300 perished in the waters.  Nowadays, however, the dikes are higher and resisted the onslaught, everywhere in northern Germany.  Off the island of Sylt, a freighter was in distress and drifting towards the island.  A tow boat, however, succeeded in linking up with the freighter which will now be towed to Cuxhaven.  Meteorologists have said unanimously that this was one of the heaviest storms in many years.  </field></doc></add>

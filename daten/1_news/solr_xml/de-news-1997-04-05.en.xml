<field name="text">The accusations of the Turkish government in the wake of the arson attack in Krefeld, which caused the death of three people, has led to new tensions in German-Turkish relations. There has still been no official reaction from Ankara to the most recent investigation results, according to which the recently arrested father is said to have set the fire. Only the Turkish daily papers reported today, in a somewhat conciliatory tone. The paper "Huerryet" reported the new developments in Krefeld on page 11. The headline proclaimed "The father is now suspected to have been the arsonist". A related editorial with a pronounced conciliatory undertone said that the Germans cannot be accused when it came to arson. The liberal paper "Yum Hurryet" devoted page 3 to the Krefeld theme. According to the headline, the PKK had  disturbed the pyre for the victims. Immediately after it came the notice on the father's arrest. The largest religiously oriented paper reported on Krefeld with a small article on the front page. Neither the Turkish Prime Minister Erbakan nor the Foreign Minister Ciller have reacted to the new development in Krefeld. On the official side there was merely a position taken by the former Turkish ambassador in Bonn and the present state secretary in the Foreign Ministry. In his opinion, even if it the arson was not the work of Neonazis, attacks by them on Turks could certainly recur. It is much like a sort of chronic illness, according to the ambassador. Foreign Minister Kinkel has again explicitly asked the Turkish politicians who made the anti-German comments to retract them. He told the paper "Welt am Sonntag" that reflexive accusations should be repressed. Megaphone diplomacy would draw people offsides, and destroy ties long in development.  </field>

<field name="text">The EU Finance Ministers met in the Dutch city Noordwijk to confer on the currency union. The Finance Ministers and National bank chiefs conferred there about the still-open points in the stability pact that is to secure the common currency, the Euro. Further themes are the future mechanism of the exchange rate and the selection process for the participants in the Euro. The pressure has reduced. Compared to the last meeting of Finance Ministers, the Noordwijk meeting is taking place under more positive circumstances. The public discussion on the postponement of the start of the Euro has become significantly less strident, and that is also noticeable in the Dutch sea resort. Directly before the beginning of the talks many of the Ministers and Commisars addressed Chancellor Helmut Kohl's desire to run once more for Chancellor. His name is inseperably tied to the unified currency, at least from the point of view of many Europeans. The Danish Finance Minister Jelvet said that if anyone still doubted that the currency union would begin on time, they would in any case not be able to give evidence for that belief. In any case it is very doubtful whether her country will participate -- for political reasons. Because of record levels of unemployment and many other bad data, many consider it unlikely that Germany will be able to fulfill the reuqirements of the Maastricht accord this year.  The Finance Ministers are in the position to set exact standards for the decisions next spring at their meeting, and thereby give a sign that everything will proceed as it has already been agreed. The leaders of the states and the governments are to determine which states will be allowed to introduce the Euro. Becouse no country will be able to incur more debts than allowed once the currency union begins, the EU governments have agreed on the stability package. The Finance Ministers discussed the legality of the agreement at this meeting. There appears to be no major opposition to be overcome.  </field>

<field name="text">A debate over the impending nomination of a candidate for Chancellor has broken out in the SPD. The speaker of the Seeheim region and member of the Bundestag, Andres, said in an interview that the SPD would not delay discussion on their candidiate for another year. The party must name its opponent to Chancellor Kohl no later than at the party convention in December. In the opinion of the chair of the Working Circle of Social Democratic women, Junker, there should be discussions as soon as the next leadership meeting. Several SPD state politicians as well as the leaders of IG Chemie and IG Bau, Schmoldt and Wiesehuegel, and the DAG chief Issen are calling on the SPD to make a quick decision. According to the existing plans the candidate would be named next April. Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Schroeder wants to keep to this time table, which would favor SPD leader LaFontaine, the Prime Minister of Hesse Eichel and Hamburg's Mayor Voscherau.  </field>

<field name="text">The children's rights convention of the UN turns five years old today. The program provided motivation for many organizations to weed out lapses in child protection. "ProAsyl" for example demanded changes in the proceedures used to expel immigrants back to Yugoslavia. The German Organization for Children's Aid demanded better living conditions for children from the German Government. Children belong in the center of society, not on its edges. This was the call of Federal Family Minister Nolte at today's celebration of the UN Children's Rights Convention. In order to address the inequality in handling children born in and out of wedlock he demanded quick reform of Child law in this session of the legislature. The Children's Commission of the Bundestag denied that the basic article of the children's rights convention was applicable to the 16 million children and youth in Germany. The Children's Commission still sees considerable deficits in child protection. Among these come the law for protection of non-smokers, better coordination rights for children and the legal assurance of an abuse-free childhood. The immigrants' aid society ProAsyl demanded protection of child refugees. Underage immigrants must not be treated like adults. Young asylum seekers must not be covered by the Third State's Rule and the Airport regulation in asylum law. According to the Third State's Rule, all immigrants who arrived by land must be sent to the nation of transit. The Airport regulation declares that asylum seekers from a safe nation of origin must go through a shortened asylum process.  </field>

<field name="text">Work Minister Bluem and President of the Bundestag Suessmuth are both in favor of legally requiring recipients of public aid to accept work that pays less than public aid. In this matter there can be no difference to the unemployed, Bluem declared in the "Saarlaendischer Rundfunk". Suessmuth, in the "Koelner Sonntagsexpress", said that recipients of public aid could no longer reject available work, because it did not make sense from an earnings point of view. The CDU politician Suessmuth however criticized the discussions about reduction in public aid. It must be clear that the point was not to make savings at the expense of the truly needy like the handicapped and the sick.  </field>

<field name="text">The CDU member of the Bundestag Louven has suggested that the employers' portion of health insurance be paid to the employees, who would then be legally required to use these funds for basic medical care. It would not be possible to reduce the total social insurance load under 40 percent without savings, Louven advised in an interview with the Cologne paper "Express". Anyone who wants luxury care would have to pay for it themselves.  </field></doc></add>

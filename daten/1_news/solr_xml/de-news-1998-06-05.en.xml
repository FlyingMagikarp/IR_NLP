<field name="text">The fatal high-speed train accident in Eschede was presumably caused by a broken and jammed wheel hoop. The Federal Train Department stated that the cause for the broken hoop remains completely unclear. Wear and tear could be excluded and so could attacks. The number ofpeople killed increased to 96 after more bodies were retrieved from the wreckage. Only one body has been identified so far. The federal government is planning a state funeral for the dead. Until Friday afternoon German Rail had checked 30 of its 59 first-generation ICE trains for potential damages. The checks caused delays, cancellations and chaotic conditions at some stations.  </field>

<field name="text">The Badem-Wuerttemberg finance ministry announced today that it has dropped the disciplinary action against Mr. Merkle, the head of the tax department. Merkle had violated the tax privacy unintentionally with negligence but the event had the character of a one-time occasion. One could assume that it would not be repeated. The prosecution had dropped the case last March because of little fault. Last year, Merkle had talked about the tax case of concert organizer Hoffman in a Stuttgart pub.  </field>

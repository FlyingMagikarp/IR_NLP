<field name="text">In the opinion of the Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Primor, the peace process in the Near East is irreversible.  On Deutschlandfunk radio this morning, he reminded that the Netanyahu Administration is committed to this policy.  However, the current government pursues a different line than its predecessors.  This has worried the neighboring states and was also the reason for the latest tensions in the region.  Mr. Netanyahu arrived for his first official visit to Germany today.  He laid down a wreath at the memorial of the former concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen before continuing his journey to Bonn where he was received by Chancellor Kohl with military honors. Mr. Netanyahu terminated his visit to Germany prematurely this evening and returned to Tel Aviv, because of heavy riots in Israel.  In Bonn, Chancellor Kohl expressed his concern, and appealed to both sides to avoid an escalation of the uprising.  </field>

<field name="text">The song writer Konstantin Wecker of Munich was sentenced to two and a half years in prison without probation on charges of cocaine possession. Mr. Wecker had acquired large amounts of cocaine over the past year which he then refined to crack.  According to the public prosecutor, he was charged with 23 counts of cocaine possession and purchase, involving a total of 1770g of cocaine.  Wecker did not deny excessive consumption of drugs, on the contrary, he explained in full detail today how he became addicted, critically ill, and how he started to live again after his arrest without drugs.  The Public Prosecution accused him of dragging his co-workers into drug addiction, even though he knew how dangerous smoking of the refined cocaine is, and pleaded for a three and a half years sentence.  His lawyers pleaded for two years on probation, presenting him as a severely addicted man who almost died from the consumption and saying that this would be enough penalty for a punished man. The judge did not agree and sentenced him to two years and six months without probation.  </field>

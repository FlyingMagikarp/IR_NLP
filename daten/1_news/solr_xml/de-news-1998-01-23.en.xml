<field name="text">The leading organisation of catholics in Germany (ZDK) proposed to reorganise the 260 family planning units, virtually re-opening them as independent associations; this would take them out of the bishops' responsibilities. The reason for this strategy was an anticipated recommendation by the Holy See to stop issuing certificates confirming to a pregnant woman that she actually been 'counselled' (required by law before an abortion can go ahead).  </field>

<field name="text">Last year the number of people suffering from AIDS dropped markedly. According to the Robert-Koch Institute there were approximately 1,000 new cases, compared to 1,500 the year before. The Institute thought that this was due to new drugs delaying the outbreak of AIDS. The number of new infections with HIV, however, remained at the same level, viz. 2,000 to 2,500 per year.  </field>

<field name="text">The battle of the spelling-reforms continued, as experts meeting in Mannheim were against a compromise allowing many current rules to stay when the new rules applied. Representatives of publishers and associations declared that this would endanger the uniformness of spelling, proposing to stick with the 1996 reform-draft instead. According to the publishers of the Duden, the 1996 draft had some weaknesses but should be acceptable to all. The teachers' union, the association for the German language and the association of German authors disagreed: they were for keeping old and new versions. The main bone of contention was when to use upper- and when lower-case, and how to hyphenate words.  </field>

<field name="text">Big business criticised the state finance ministers' decision to accept tax-returns in Euro (the future common European currency) only as of 2002, claiming that Germany would lead the tail-end in this respect. Especially small- and medium-sized businesses would get hurt by having to do their accounting in two currencies (doubling up on double-entry bookkeeping).  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Schneider, high-flyer/crasher to the tune of billions of marks, will have to do time in jail - without the perks. The state prosecutor said that living outside the prison (and coming back at night) would only be acceptable to the law if a defendant had not previously been remanded, which did not apply in Mr Schneider's case. And there still was unfinished business as far as his bankruptcy was concerned.  </field></doc></add>

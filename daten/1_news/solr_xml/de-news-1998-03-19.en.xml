<field name="text">Faulty evidence in the case of the attack on the Penal Institution of Justice in Weiterstadt has lead to this decision made at the Higher Regional Court in Frankfurt. The judges' verdict could not be deduced from the immediate acting of the defendant. The life sentence for Hogefeld remains active though due to other crimes she committed. Hogefeld had been convicted of murder and other crimes during one of the last major proceedings of RAF terrorists in 1996.  </field>

<field name="text">Three days after 11-year-old Christina disappeared from the Weser-Ems district police and German army troops are still desperately searching for the girl. A first trail was found yesterday when the backpack of the girl was found along the shore of the Weser-Ems-Channel. Divers were searching the bottom of the channel with underwater cameras and a sonar device. A search team of about 500 persons is still searching both shores. The backpack was apparently washed ashore so it is hard to say where the girl lost it. Several hundred clues from citizens have been received, but not a hot one.  </field>

<field name="text">Anti-nuclear protestors and the police are engaged in a new standoff as a controversial shipment of spent fuel rods begins its rail journey to Ahaus. The containers from Grundremmingen and Neckarwestheim will be brought together at a coal power plant in Wahlheim near Stuttgart. From there about 60 tonnes of radioactive fuel rods will be railed to an interim storage facility in Ahaus. The protestors blocked Gate 2 of the nuclear power plant in Neckarwestheim to stop the shipment. Apparently the shipment from Neckarwestheim is endangered by a street tunnel. Policemen were busy trying to get the protestors out of the tunnel. Two protestors chained themselves in a cave under the shipment route. Policemen with spades and pick-axes tried to reach the buried protestors.  </field>

<field name="text">The EU Commision has caused an outcry with its proposition for future agrarian and farming-structure policies. The President of the German Farmer's Association, Sonnleitner, called the plan disastrous and accused Brussels of a calculated strategy to destroy jobs. The Federal Government announced opposition against the EU plan which would be realized in 1999 at the earliest. But already this year Bonn wants to ease the farmers' lives. Starting July 1st , a tax lump sum will be increased to 10%. Bonn will also change another law so that farmers can have more cattle without being disadvantaged taxwise. The Federal Minister of Agriculture, Jochen Borchert, rejects the EU plan and announced that major changes will be made in collaboration with other EU countries.  </field>

<field name="text">Experts of the economy are expecting a drastic increase in pension premium rates. Without a change of the current system the rate will increase from the current 20.3% to 25% by the year 2030, and afterwards to 28%. The experts suggested to invest a part of the contributions made to the legal pension plan in a private retirement fund or insurance. With this system the aspired pension level of 64% of average net earnings could be maintained even after the year 2030.  </field>

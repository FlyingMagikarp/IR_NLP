<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl has met in Bonn today with President Chirac of France. European politics and international topics were on the agenda.  The central issue was the implementation of the uniform European currency according to schedule.  Prior to the talks, the Federal Ministry of Finance had conceded that this year, Germany will most likely not be able to meet the criteria of the Maastricht treaty.  Kohl and Chirac nevertheless want to keep the schedule toward the European Economic and Currency Union.  After the meeting, Kohl said in Bonn that both countries are committed to apply the criteria of the Maastricht treaty without exception.  Chirac explained that one is aware of the economic difficulties and the impact on society.  However, Germany and France will be ready by the designated deadline.  Commenting on the proposal to postpone the membership of certain countries until 1999, Kohl said it is a mistake to envision such scenarios before the decision has to be made.  He concluded saying that in the long run, freedom, peace, and social stability in Europe can only be insured by growing closer together.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Interior Minister Kanther came out in favor of returning Bosnian refugees to their home country in fall.  On Deutschlandfunk radio he did not rule out issuing corresponding orders, because he is under the assumption that calling for a voluntary return will probably prove insufficient. Moreover, he recalled that the date to start the return had already been moved once, from July 1 to October 1.  He expects the convention of the State Interior Ministers, convening in mid-September, to determine a binding resolution in this question.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl has called on representatives of research and economy to cooperate more closely in the future.  At the annual reception at the research facility Juelich, Kohl criticized that in Germany the road from an invention to a marketable product is still too long.  In order to convert research results in a faster and better way, all parties have to intensify their cooperation.  Only then can the location Germany remain competitive in the 21st century.  Kohl called on scientists to found more high-tech companies, because one could sometimes get the impression that science and economy live in two different worlds with very few points of contact.  </field>

<field name="text"> Within the framework of the planned tax reform, Federal Finance Minister Waigel intends to cap income tax at less than 40%.  In an interview with ZDF [public TV station], Waigel announced to simultaneously lower the entry-level tax rate to about 20%.  In view of a possible increase in V.A.T. [value added tax, sales tax], the Minister said it is important to attain the right ratio between direct and indirect taxes.  Excessive direct taxes are harmful for the economy, services and export.  Commenting on reports about new budget deficits of billions of DM, Waigel said that he had based his calculation of a borrowing level of 59 billion DM on revenue estimates and economic parameters which were current at the time.  In the meantime, the economy took a different turn, though.  For instance, the Federal Labor Office had to spend eight billion DM more than projected, due to high unemployment.  Waigel said he is not willing to yield to the FDP's urging to enact the grand tax reform ahead of schedule, in 1998.  The FDP should stick to what the coalition had agreed on this spring, the Minister emphasized.  If a conflict in this matter is necessary, it will be fought out, Waigel concluded.  </field>

Simultaneously, the number of new applications from the states of the former Soviet Union plunged by almost half, the Ministry informed.

<field name="text">The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection, Mr. Jakob, criticized the data protection practice at Deutsche Telekom [German telecommunications monopolist].  Jakob said on Hessischer Rundfunk radio that the brochures, accompanying telephone bills since August, informing about novel directory services on CD-ROM and "Comfort Inquiry" are completely insufficient.  The publication is designed in such a way that telephone customers cannot recognize their legal rights that the offer entails.  For instance, the form does not provide the option to decline the listing of personal data on the CD-ROM version.  Customers have to raise their objection separately in writing, a fact the company has not publicized.  The commissioner put forward to repeat the campaign in a clear and transparent way.  </field>

<field name="text">The CDU/CSU spokesman for transportation-related issues, Mr. Geis, has demanded stricter penalties for truck drivers who do not observe breaks required by law.  Geis commented the case of a truck driver, who was stopped after 44 hours behind the wheel, by saying that those who act in such an irresponsible way should be punished like drivers under the influence of intoxicants.  Geis endorsed withdrawing the driver's license in such cases. Moreover, Geis said one has to evaluate if employers who force their drivers to excessive working hours behind the wheel could be punished as abettors.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the chairman of the union of police (GDP), Mr. Lutz, crimes committed by children and juveniles have assumed a frightening extent.  Lutz told the Bild am Sonntag Sunday newspaper that Germany is heading toward American conditions.  Based on figures for the first half of the year, an increase of more than 10% in criminal offenses committed by children and juveniles has to be expected for 1996.  The perpetrators are of younger and younger age, and their methods become more and more reckless and violent. This is a sign for a continued brutalization, Lutz said.  Even eleven or twelve-year-olds commit crimes.  The GDP president called on the parents to live up to their responsibility in raising their children.  Eleven and twelve-year-olds are loitering in the streets until late at night, without the parents' knowing about their offsprings' whereabouts.  The police cannot be held liable for this development.  </field>

<field name="text">The Stuttgart branches of the Kaufhof department store chain are being blackmailed for millions of Marks. According to a police statement issued last night, an unidentified party has threatened to poison foodstuffs of the stores unless his ransom demands are met. Apparently, suspect goods have already been discovered at three warehouses. Present information is that only dairy products have been affected. Police reports indicate, however, that initial examinations have found no trace of poison. Consumers are advised to examine the packaging of milk, quark, and yoghurt products purchased at Kaufhof stores and to give suspicious goods to the police.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Federation of Unions (DGB) has called on the Government and all the parties in the Bundestag to implement an apprenticeship tax. The DGB's idea is that every company in Germany which could reasonably offer apprenticeship training positions but doesn't would pay the tax; the money would go toward financing such positions in businesses which do offer them. The Government rejects the idea. Meanwhile, the president of the Council of German Chambers of Commerce, Stihl, has said that he expects the Germany economy to supply 300,000 training positions in 1998.  </field>

<field name="text">The plan to tie increased public health insurance contributions to higher pay-outs for medications will not take effect this year. Several newspapers published reports to this effect, quoting sources from within the Coalition in Bonn. According to the "Hannover'sche Allgemeine Zeitung" newspaper, the decision will apply to all rate hikes between march 11 and December 31. The reports add that the deferment is formulated in an amendment which is to be debated in the Bundestag Health Committee today. The newspapers explain that the deferment is intended to help the Eastern German public health insurance companies, which are under intense financial pressure. The leaders of the CDU, CSU, and FDP parties and parliamentary groups had come to an agreement to end the separation of risk-structure equalizations between the West and the East, which has been in place until now.  </field>

<field name="text">After Japan and the United States, Germany gives more money in foreign aid than any other country. That is the result of an international comparison published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris. The study was based on data from the year 1996, and shows Germany, spending 7.6 billion dollars, passing France, for the first time, with its 7.5 billion dollars. The study also shows, however, that developmental aid is down world-wide, from 58.9 billion dollars in 1995 to 55.5 billion dollars in 1996. The OECD said that a solid and flexible finance system was an essential prerequisite for economic development in poor countries.  </field>

<field name="text">A member of faculty at the Bundeswehr Military Academy, Lieutenant Colonel Barandat, testified today before the parliamentary investigation committee on the Roeder affair. He said that four months after Roeder's presentation at the Academy in January 1995, he had made the former chief of staff at the Academy, Schwarzer, aware that Roeder was a neo-Nazi. In testimony given earlier, Schwarzer claimed not to have known about Roeder's right-wing background, and described the invitation issued to him to speak at the Academy as an embarrassing occurrence, which he had hoped would be forgotten. This evening, Federal Defence Minister Ruehe is scheduled to testify.  </field>

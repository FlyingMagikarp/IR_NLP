<field name="text">Former CDU treasurer Leisler Kiep testified for ten hours before the Public Prosecutor about supposed donations of millions of DMarks to the party. The leading public prosecutor in the case, Reinhard Nemetz, said afterwards that the arrangements of the transfer of funds from arms dealer Karlheinz Schreiber had been "thoroughly discussed". The lawyer indicated that the money had been sent to several different people. He also said that Kiep had been very cooperative. The CDU has refuted reports of party donations in illegal accounts, saying that the accounts involved were official ones which the donors happened to know about.  </field>

<field name="text">The premium rates for public old-age security will fall to 19.3% next year. The federal cabinet today approved a pension report presented by Labour Minister Walter Riester, which contains that provision. In 1998, the rate was 20.3%. According to the labour ministry, the change will mean that people with average incomes will keep an extra 272 DMarks per year. In the following years, until 2003, the rates will continue to sink, subsequently stabilizing at about 19%. The loss in federal revenue accompanying the rate drop is to be made up for through increased revenue from the eco-tax.  </field>

<field name="text">In a pilot trial concerning pornography on the internet, former Compuserve boss Felix Somm has, on appeal, been acquitted by the Regional Court in Munich. In 1998 the District Court in Munich sentenced Somm to 2 years' imprisonment and a 100,000 DM fine - as an accomplice in the distribution of child and animal pornography on the internet. The central argument in Somm's appeal of the sentence was the question of whether an internet service provider can prevent access to illegal files. Experts testified that they could not.  </field>

<field name="text">The boss of the Public Service and Transportation Union (OeTV), Herbert Mai, and that of the National Trade Union Federation (DGB), Dieter Schulte, speaking at the OeTV special congress in Dortmund, have encouraged support for the planned super-union called Verdi. The Unified Service Union ("vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft" - Verdi) is the best chance to give the trade union movement a future, according to Mai; with over 3 million members, it would be a powerful organization. Besides the OeTV and DGB, the following unions would also like to join the super-union: Trade, Banking, and Insurance (HBV); Media (IG Medien); the National Union of Employees (DAG); and the German Postal Union (DPG). These other unions will hold their congresses beginning on Thursday. The discussions are scheduled to finish by weekend.  </field>

<field name="text">After a long dispute, the 114,000 federally-owned apartments previously reserved for railway employees may now be sold. An arbitration committee in Frankfurt made the decision today. The staff council of the Federal Railway Asset holding company [established to manage former railway properties and goods which the federal administration retained when the railway was privatized], the German Renters' Association (deutscher Mieterbund), and the Railway Union (GdED) opposed the sale. In March, the federal government decided to sell the apartments to private interests. Two parties have offered 7.1 and 8.1 billion DMarks, respectively. Today's decision guarantees the railway employees living in the apartments the life-long right to continue renting their apartments, and moderate rental increases.  </field></doc></add>

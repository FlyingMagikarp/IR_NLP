<field name="text">The parliamentary party leader of the PDS, Gysi, holds the CDU and CSU somehow responsible for the death of the Algerian in Guben/Brandenburg. According to him, from the signature campaign against the double citizenship the people only learn that they sign against foreign fellow citizens. Gysi wants the CDU/CSU parliamentary party leader, Schaeuble, to stop the campaign. After the tragedy of Guben, the political parties mainly blame each other instead of being sorry about what happened. According to the regional CDU-chairman, Schoenbohm, the Government of Brandenburg welcomes the positive development of right-radical parties, because so they can take some percent points from the CDU. The SPD of Brandenburg characterized Schoenbohm's statement as a depressing violation of the political style. In the night from Saturday to Sunday, a 28-year-old Algerian died of loss of blood after crashing in a window pane. He was running away from 15 skinheads. 8 of the supposed pursuers had been arrested until now.  </field>

<field name="text">SPD challenger Schroeder called Chancellor Kohl "unsuited for the future." After 16 years in power, Kohl is no longer able to cluster the nation's creative capacities, Schroeder said during the Bundestag general debate on the 1999 budget. The Chancellor no longer perceives the situation of average wage earners, he stressed. Kohl split the nation in a social sense by his policies. In response, Union faction leader Schaeuble accused Schroeder of having drawn a caricature of reality in his envy-filled speech.

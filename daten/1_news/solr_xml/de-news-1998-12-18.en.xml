<field name="text">All parties represented in the Bundestag with the exception of PDS came out in favor of the US/British military action. The gist of all comments was that Saddam Hussein bears sole responsibility. Foreign minister Fischer hopes for an early cease-fire. He said, "We hope that this military action will soon come to an end and politics can reassume its rightful place to achieve a durable and peaceful solution to the benefit of Iraq's population."  </field>

<field name="text">There were physicians' protest marches against a possible reduction of ambulant medical treatment in several Bavarian cities today. Emergency services were set up in strike-bound clinics in Wuerzburg, Nuernberg and Munich. Doctors are being criticized by many who see the fear of diminishing income at the root of the protest action. The Medical Association refutes this. The protest is in favor of patients, says MA chairman Wittek.  </field>

<field name="text">Finance minister Lafontaine defended his tax reform plan before the Bundesrat (upper chamber). After years of a supply oriented policy favoring business, it was now the time for bolstering demand, he said. This was the only way to give impulse to employment and the overall economy. The Bundesrat approved two laws today: one lowering the initial income tax level, the other increasing child subsidies. Most of the innovations will be implemented by January. Child subsidy will iuncrease by DM 30 to DM 250 per month. The new initial income tax level will be 23.9%. Sick pay is back to 100%. Bavaria's premier Stoiber, who had earlier attacked the red/green plans, reiterated his attacks in the Bundesrat. "The federal government cannot promise benefits  like increased child subsidies and lower tax levels if it does not pay for them out of its own pocket. And this is a federal matter". The main tax reform legislation is to be voted in March with retroactive effect.  </field>

<field name="text">Data protection commissioner Vetter presented a report today which shows up massive instances of violation. It states, among other items, that punks or skinheads are often submitted to criminal identification without giving cause. Bavaria-wide criminal records contain many facts about persons for too long a time stretch and without justification. Also, the 350 page report chides police for their treatment of Sinti and Roma. Their license plates are stored in police data banks quasi preventively,without justifiable cause.  </field></doc></add>

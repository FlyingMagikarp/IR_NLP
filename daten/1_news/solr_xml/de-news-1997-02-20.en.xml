<field name="text"> The Federal Bank has demanded speedy reforms to gain control over the economic difficulties in Germany.  The latest monthly report issued by the monetary watchdogs in Frankfurt states that current measures are probably insufficient to rectify all structural problems. The economic uptrend still lacks self-sustaining dynamics.  High unemployment and sluggish growth could jeopardize Germany's membership of the European Monetary Union.  President Tietmeyer of the Bundesbank called on federal, state and municipal governments to introduce stricter controls on spending.  </field>

<field name="text"> The dispute between government and SPD over the monopoly of the Postal Service is nowhere near a resolution.

During the preceding discussion of the annual economic report, Finance Minister Waigel had called for a concerted effort for economic growth and employment.  He announced further budget cuts and measures to promote investments.  </field>

<field name="text"> According to experts, pension contributions can be maintained at a stable 20% only if the retirement age is increased from the current 65 years to 72 years.  The only alternative would be a drastic cut in pension payments from 70% to 55% of the last salary, the newspaper "BILD" reported, with reference to the National Association of German Pension Insurers (VdR).  According to VdR, the government proposition to freeze pension premiums at current levels would entail dramatic cuts in future pension payments.  </field>

<field name="text"> The Bavarian Minister of Economics Wiesshoy expects unemployment figures for the state to fall between now and the middle of the year and economic growth to increase.  A growth rate of 2.7% is a realistic figure, he said at his annual press conference.  The favourable climate has been created by low interest rates, stable prices and only moderate increases in wages.  Export figures for Bavaria are still at record levels, with the main customer being the United States.  Industry's reticence to make new investments poses the biggest problem, Mr. Wiesshoy said.  With this in mind, he called for the creation of better conditions, stressing the tax reform as the single most important issue.  The Bavarian Bureau of Statistics recently issued a report stating that GDP rose by 2.0% last year, after an increase of 1.6% in the previous year.  </field>

<field name="text"> The death of the 14-year-old schoolgirl Sabine at a ski-camp in Austria has been solved.  The public health department in Lauf stated that the girl's fatal illness was caused by a virus infection, linked to the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.  This was confirmed by micro-biological tests.  If, as in Sabine's case, the virus infects a weak immune system, then the consequences can be fatal.  The 14-year-old girl from Altdorf near Nuremberg died two weeks ago at a ski-camp in the Austrian town of Saalbach.  Many of her fellow class mates also became very ill from the infection.  It was at first suspected that the teenagers had a legionella virus infection, but this theory was dismissed after an analysis of the drinking water in Saalbach.  </field>

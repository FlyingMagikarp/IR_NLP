<field name="text">Wrapping up their meeting in Stuttgart, the state premiers also discussed the planned opening of the EU to include former Communist countries. That could happen quite quickly, according to their resolution, albeit candidates would have to get initiated gradually. At the same time they wanted to have a say in matters concerning EU-subsidies. And they also dug into the spelling-reform. The heads of state backed the reform, and stated that there was no need for either a compact signed by all the states or a law. Language was a dynamic process defying all attempts to control it, according to Mr Erwin Teufel, the current president of the state premiers' conference. Though we should stay open to proposals for amendments, and that was why there would be talks with both houses of parliament. The state premiers also agreed to put in writing that the use of the Internet to listen to the radio/watch TV would not attract any licence-fees until the year 2003. They also were in favour of digital multimedia as that would be good for consumers.  </field>

<field name="text">The discovery of another video glorifying brutality poured oil on the flames of the discussion about how to handle right-wing radicals in the armed forces. A spokes-person for the Defence Ministry said that they needed more data to vet recruits' backgrounds. The SPD-party declared that they did not believe in one-off events any more: these new videos had been recorded more than two years ago. Mr Marienfeld, special commissioner for the armed forces, asked for more supervision of conscripts. He said that the armed forces had had a marked increase in right-wing radical incidents lately. SPD-politicians also asked why the shots had taken several years to surface. Defence Minister Ruehe's theory that it was all a one-off event, was not to be taken seriously any more. Spokes-persons for the ministry said that the fact that officers had taken part as well had added a new dimension. The footage fills eight hours, shot between 1993 and 1995, 45 minutes of which show soldiers raising their right arms for the so-called Hitler's salute, and related right-wing radical emblems. Defence Minister Ruehe kicked off another attempt to detect eventual trouble-makers early on. Minister of Justice Schmidt-Jortzig of the FDP, however, is still against obtaining data from future conscripts' criminal register.  </field>

<field name="text">If a conscript has been offered an apprenticeship he may obtain a stay, according to the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin, but this is subject to certain conditions. The apprenticeship takes precedence, even if it has not been taken up yet. One of the conditions is that the apprenticeship is more than likely to 'get lost' if the applicant were to join the armed forces first. As there are few apprenticeships and jobs in general, this would justify a stay. Case in point: a young candidate from Lower Saxony had been offered an apprenticeship with German Post. He will have to prove that he would lose the apprenticeship if he did his military service first.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Joschka Fischer, speaker for the Greens' parliamentary group, asked his party to stop the infighting and bickering about a party manifest for the upcoming federal elections. On television he stated that goals such as disbanding NATO were unrealistic. Discussions about this issue would also hurt the party. "We, the Greens, have stuck to our knitting and kicked off a public debate that apparently hurts us more than our political enemies. There are some valid points, but politics is about things that can be done, not proclaiming what's impossible. I don't think long-range goals should be in a manifest."  </field>

<field name="text">Baden-Wuerttemberg's state premier Erwin Teufel will keep his job as head of the local CDU, according to the vast majority of the delegates at the state party conference in Rust. Chancellor Kohl and head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group Schaeuble were also present. The latter were being watched pretty closely, but Mr Teufel set the cat among the pigeons openly tackling the issue of succession (Mr Schaeuble has been called the 'eternal successor'): "The Baden-Wuerttemberg CDU backs Mr Helmut Kohl and also without any ifs and buts his running for Chancellor at the 1998 federal elections!" didn't draw much of an applause. The delegates were a lot more enthusiastic when he addressed Mr Schaeuble, and there was quite a bit of cheering for him. In spite of Mr Schaeuble apparently attracting more votes than Mr Kohl, the party cannot have two candidates for the same position - a 1998-one and one for later on, whenever that may be.  </field>

<field name="text">So far health insurers pay a percentage of actual costs. The new system is still being fine-tuned, but dentists already have given it the green light. This is to put a cap on costs. Inexpensive treatment will set benchmarks. If you, for example, prefer to have a ceramic filling instead of the run-of-the-mill one, you will end up paying more. Nothing has been finalised so far, but arbitration agencies expect a huge rise in dissatisfied patients.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">In May at the earliest, the inquiry committee of the Bundestag will interrogate Ex-Chancellor Kohl. Today Kohl informed auditors instructed by the CDU about the practice of Party funding during his term of office. Chancellor Schroeder distanced himself from considerations of the inquiry committee to put Kohl into jail in case he does not tell the names of the contributors. Schroeder's opinion is that Kohl knows about his duties as a citizen and that he will fulfill these. In the meantime, the CDU-Secretary General, Merkel, indirectly appealed to the former Chancellor to reveal the names. But the substitute CDU-leader, Ruehe, appealed to the contributors themselves to confess. Apparently at the same time, the search in the Chancellor's Office for the vanished documents concerning the sale of the Leuna-Factory to the French company Elf-Aquitaine continues. According to Government speaker Heye, it turned out that the originals in several folders are missing. At the best, there are copies, but some folders are totally empty. And this does not only concern the files of the Leuna-deal.  </field>

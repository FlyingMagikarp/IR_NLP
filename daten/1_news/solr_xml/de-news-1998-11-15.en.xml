<field name="text">Otto Schily, the German Minister of the Interior, is against the immigration of more foreigners. In an interview with the paper the "Berliner Tagesspiegel" Mr. Schily said that the stress through immigration is already too great. He said that legislation on immigration would not change anything about that as the quota for immigration should be set at zero. He continued that  European solution has to be found for asylum seekers and civil war refugees. The greatest danger for the stability of Germany is right wing extremism which is increasing among teenagers. He said that it is true that the police do not always prosecute members of right-wing extremist gangs which he considered an alarming situation.  </field>

<field name="text">The Greens are of the opinion that there should be no more observation of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) by the German Domestic Intelligence Agency. The speaker of the Green Parliamentary Group on legal issues, Mr. Beck, does not think further observation is necessary because the observation only casts the successor party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) into the role of victim. According to Mr. Beck, a general discussion about the value of the observation of enemies of the constitution by the Domestic Intelligence Agency should be initiated. Minister of the Interior Schily had declared several days ago that he will look into current investigations of the PDS.  </field>

<field name="text">Gauck, the Commissioner for Stasi documents (East Germany's former Secret Police) thinks it is a problematic development that the PDS is participating in the government of Mecklenburg-Pomerania. Mr. Gauck told the weekly "Bild am Sonntag" that he considers it a problem if government positions are filled prematurely with people who have not fully broken with the past. He said that the PDS is an ecosystem for those who have not arrived at democracy. He thinks that red-red coalitions in East Germany will be the consequence. Mr. Gauck gave assurances that his agency will continue to exist for another 20 to 30y ears. At the moment, the agency receives 10,000 inquiries from citizens each month.  </field>

<field name="text">Politicians from Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) have asked the US government to return all documents stolen from the former East German  Secret Police during the "Wende" (change). So far, the position of the USA on this issue was more that of a superior power than that of a friendly partner said Mr. Penner, the Chairman of the Bundestag Committee on interior politics. Mr. Zeitelmann, a CSU politician  said that the refusal of the USA to return the documents was unacceptable and arrogant. During the dissolution of the Honecker regime, the US Secret Service had stolen documents and removed them to the USA. Mr. Gauck's agency needs the documents to solve cases of injustice and repression in the former East Germany.  </field>

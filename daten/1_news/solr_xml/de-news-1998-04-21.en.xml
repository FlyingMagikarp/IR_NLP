<field name="text">The parliamentary committees for finances, foreign affairs and Europe recommended that the parliament approves the introduction of the Euro currency on 1 January 1999. Thus, a wide acceptance of the common currency in the two houses of parliament, Bundestag and Bundesrat, seems guaranteed. In a joint hearing Chancellor Helmut Kohl had promoted again the Euro and stressed that the monetary union would also advance the political union in Europe. Kohl said the monetary union is the most important decision since the re-unification of the two German states. The conditions for the stability of the new currency have never been as good as today. In the Bundesrat even Euro-sceptics seem to turn around. The state premiers of Lower-Saxony, Bavaria, and Baden-Wuerttemberg said they would vote in favour. Saxony is going to vote against the common currency. The Bundestag will decide on Thursday, the Bundesrat on Friday about the introduction of the Euro.  </field>

<field name="text">The state premiers of East Germany have criticized strongly the FDP congress' resolution to abolish the solidarity tax completely. [The tax was introduced to help East Germany after the re-unification.]. Thuringia's State Premier Vogel said he who wants to abolish the solidarity tax gives the impression that the time of solidarity was over. Saxony-Anhalt's State Premier Reinhard Hoeppner accused the FDP of having discarded the East. The State Premier of Mecklenburg-East Pomerania Bernhardt Seite said the subsidy of the new states must not be touched. The FDP, however, stated that there was no disagreement in the government coalition about the demand to reduce taxes drastically and to abolish the solidarity tax completely. FDP faction leader Dorothee Solms stated that each party has the right to independently adopt its own election platform for the following legislative period. This was not a breach of the coalition contract. Therefore, this topic was not raised at the coalition meeting this morning.  </field>

<field name="text">In a hearing by the parliamentary immunity committee PDS politician Gregor Gysi has stated again that he has never worked for the Stasi [the former East German domestic intelligence service]. He accused the committee of trying to discredit him morally and politically. The committee had found in March that there was unequivocal evidence that Gysi had worked as an Unofficial Collaborator for the Stasi. Gysi has tried in vain to have the report halted by the Federal Constitutional Court.  </field>

<field name="text">The voluntary disbandment of the terrorist "Red Army Fraction" (RAF) has started up a broad discussion of the possible legal consequences. Union politicians and constitution protectors have warned against a premature lifting or relaxing of the anti-terrorist legislation brought into place in the 1970s. Buendnis 90/The Greens argued however, that the legislation should be annulled following the disbandment of the RAF. The acting chairman of the SPD parliamentary fraction Schily and the FDP politician Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger called for a relaxation of rules on criminal prosecution. The Federal Crime Office reckons that the letter published yesterday announcing the disbandment of the terrorist group as genuine. The criminological examination showed that the RAF star on the letter corresponded exactly with the symbol used in previous letters. The water mark on the letter was also identical to that of previous letters.  </field>

<field name="text">The length of time it takes for domestic mail to reach its destination has decreased further. Some 94 out of 100 items are arriving within one day, the Post HQ in Bonn announced. 99 percent of all letters arrive at least within two days. Four years ago the results were only 83 percent arrival in one day. The mail service puts the improvement down to the establishment of around 60 mail centres. These centres can, depending on their capacity, deal with up to 4.5 million items each day.  </field>

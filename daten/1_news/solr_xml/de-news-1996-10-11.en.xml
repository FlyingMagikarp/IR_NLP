<field name="text">When visiting Indonesia, Chancellor Kohl is to talk turkey as far as human rights are concerned, according to a resolution passed by opposition parties and civil rights groups. Politicians of the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens parties asked for that in a reaction to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize. The society for peoples at risk asked the chancellor, to put an immediate stop to military aid for Indonesia. Chancellor Kohl will visit Indonesia while travelling to Asia from 25 October to 2 November. He also plans to visit the Philippines and Japan.  </field>

<field name="text">Today the government coalition parties passed a law introducing detention before the main trial into German criminal law procedures. This would enable courts to detain offenders caught red-handed immediately, in case they are likely to be sentenced to a maximum of one year's prison and if the main trial (as opposed to the depositions hearing) is to begin within a week.  This form of detention is a mitigated form of remand. In the future, an offender may be detained for a maximum of 7 days if the judicial side of things is clear, it is likely there will be a quick sentence and if formal remand would not be commensurate with the offence committed. Left- and right-wing so-called chaos-tourists would fit the criteria, as spokespersons for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group explained.  A bit of background: two years ago a decision was made to speed up trials, but the measures lacked bite as many offenders did not turn up at the trial. Opposition spokespersons claimed the amendment was controversial as far the constitution was concerned. And things were not obvious and clear as far as the above-mentioned offenders were concerned, thus voiding the conditions for detention and fast-track trials.  </field>

<field name="text">Today the SPD-party asked for a debate, in parliament, on the law to block wage-dumping on German construction sites using seconded foreign workers. As the ministry still was unable to agree on minimum wages, this law will remain a paper-tiger. According to the SPD, the ministry has not done their job yet, and wants them to amend the existing law. The minister said no, as that would mean infringing on the autonomy of award-partners. "We do not want to set minimum-wages by decree, and we do not want government to decide, in case of litigation, what the wage should be." He asked employers and staff to agree to the already settled minimum hourly pay-rates of 17 marks for West Germany and 15.64 marks for East Germany. Employers want to cancel this agreement as early as of May, whereas the unions would only accept a 31 December 1997 deadline, at the earliest. The latter claim that they need time to check if this would really help German construction workers.  </field>

<field name="text">In 2002 the Federal parliament will be reduced to 598 seats, according to draft legislation passed by the governing coalition parties. This was mainly uncontroversial, though there are some differences of opinion between government and opposition parties about the eventual compensation of so-called overhang seats.  </field>

<field name="text">Last year, parliament's commission for citizens' complaints (Petitionsausschuss) received more than 21,000 petitions. According to the commission's president Nickels, of the Greens Party, these days, when there is no money in the till and economic and social problems are getting bigger, this commission is becoming more and more important for the general population. This would also explain the strong rise in petitions as far as superannuation and health were concerned.  </field>

<field name="text">The coalition parties agreed to changes to the controversial law to boost employment, according to the Federal Ministry for Labour in Bonn. In the future, staff employed on work-schemes will only get 80% (currently 90%) of comparable award-rates, and any exemptions where subsidies can top them up to 100% will be limited. And now there will be a cap on monthly maximum pay for people on work-schemes: 4130 marks in West Germany and 3500 marks in East Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">Former German Democratic Republic police officers can be dismissed if there is proof that they also worked for the then Secret Police (Stasi), according to a recent ruling by the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) in Kassel. Having implicitly agreed to working for them would be sufficient; there was no requirement for an explicit contract. Case in point: a Berlin CIB-police officer had been re-employed after re-unification, but dismissed later on because of his former involvement with the Stasi.  </field>

<field name="text">In September the cost of living in Germany was up 1.4% compared to last year's figures, while it dropped .1% compared to the month of August, according to the Federal Department of Statistics. This means that inflation is at its lowest level since re-unification in 1990.  </field>

<field name="text">More than 10 years after the disco La Belle had been the subject of a bomb-attack, police have arrested two more suspects. A 37-year old German female is to have planted the bomb in the disco, under instructions from her then husband, a man born in Palestine. They both are accused of murder and having caused an explosion, and there was fresh evidence to prove it, according to the state prosecutor. Two American soldiers and a woman had been killed when the disco La Belle was blown up in April 1986. The Berlin authorities now also issued arrest-warrants for former staff of the Libyan embassy in the (former) German Democratic Republic, who are alleged to have helped with preparations for the attack. As early as in May, Palestinian Yassir Hedi, who is state-less, was extradited to Berlin. He is alleged to have been one of the people pulling the strings behind the scene.  </field>

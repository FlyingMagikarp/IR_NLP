<field name="text">SPD party leader Lafontaine put the recent statements on collaboration with the PDS ino perspective.  Following a meeting of the SPD party council today, he said that these statements did not contain any new information.  He said, "We will continue to deal with this issue for the next 10 years if necessary, if no other important issues arise." The position of the SPD remains the same: The east-German state associations can decide for themselves whether they would like to work together with the PDS. Since such a position already existed, the Dresden Statement by the SPD from 1994 was obsolete. This statement had ruled out any cooperation with the PDS.  </field>

<field name="text">The Ministry of Agriculture in Bonn announced that the second round of talks on the agricultural reform of the European Union in Brussels was postponed until Thursday. The Ministry's postponement was in response to a request from the French government. The Paris government stated that it wanted to gain time to search for a compromise in the discussion on agricultural reform. Last Friday, the first round of talks on financing the EU agriculture budget were postponed primarily after differences between France and Germany on financing aspects. Federal chancellor Schroeder once again called on the European political leaders to quickly remove all obstacles to EU reforms. During the conference of the social-democratic party of Europe in Milan, Schroeder demanded that the so-called agenda 2000 be passed this year.  </field>

<field name="text">The number of drug-related deaths in Germany last year was 11.5% higher than in 1997. The number had climbed to 1600. In light of the current numbers, Christa Nickels, the drug commissioner of the federal government, referred to them as "a disturbing trend." The increase in socalled first-time users of hard drugs is also unfortunate. Their number increased in 1998 to almost 21,000, exactly 1.7% higher than the previous year. While drug use among adults did not increase, the number of teens using drugs increased. According to Christa Nickels, tobacco remained the number one drug, followed closely by alcohol.  </field>

<field name="text">The Western States reacted with skepticism on news about a supposed partly retreat of Yugoslavian forces out of the Kosovo. Defense Minister Scharping called this only a propaganda maneuver. He emphasized that so far, there are no signs for such a retreat. A NATO-speaker in Brussels said the same. He referred to the possibility that Belgrade speaks of a retreat, while in reality only an exchange takes place. The US-President, Clinton, and the British Prime Minister, Blair, reminded that the NATO demands much more than only a retreat of troops. It would be very important that the refugees could return safely. An international guarding force would be necessary. The special commissioner of the EU for the Balkan, Petric, declared that the news from Belgrade must be examined very carefully. In the best case, the new circumstances could lead to a de-escalation. Today, the air attacks of the NATO continued unchanged.  </field>

The speaker of the executive board Roestel, emphasized that harmonizes with the policy of foreign minister Fischer. Chancellor Schroeder shortens his visit to China from four days to one. According to his foreign policy counselor, Steiner, it is the aim of the dialogue on Wednesday to win over the Chinese to support a diplomatic solution for the Kosovo-conflict instead of the bombardment of their embassy in Belgrade. A jointly position in the UN security council is absolutely necessary. Upon China's application, the council will meet today in New York to discuss the incident. In Paris, the French president Chirac regretted the bombardment of the embassy. He was talking of an accident and expressed an understanding for Beijing's reaction. There happened new demonstrations in front of the embassies of the USA and Great Britain. In the evening, Chancellor Schroeder was informed by NATO secretary-general about the circumstances of the attack on the embassy. So far, the Chancellor had called the statements as insufficient.  </field>

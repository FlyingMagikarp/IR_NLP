<field name="text">There was a devastating multiple car pile-up this morning on the Autobahn A8 Stuttgart - Muenchen between Merklingen and Ulm-West due to thick fog. Three people were killed, and approximately fifty were injured (some of them severely). According to the police, twelve mass accidents involving a total of ninety vehicles occurred in both directions. According to information thus far, a tourist bus drove into an automobile ahead of it. Another bus then drove into the first bus. The collisions in thick fog caused the first multiple car pile-up. An automobile caught fire. The other multiple pile-ups occurred shortly thereafter. Another collision occurred in the opposite lane that was probably caused by curious onlookers. Witnesses at the scene reported that pieces of wreckage were strewn over more than 500 meters. The Autobahn was closed in both directions. The fog warning system in this section of the Autobahn has been turned off for weeks for repairs. The regional Department for Street Maintenance in Stuttgart had not counted on fog conditions already. According to initial estimates by the police, damages will total approx. 1.5 million D-Marks. Bundesfinanzminister Waigel offered his condolences to the victims of the accident. Waigel wanted to fly from Stuttgart to Vienna for the EU meeting of federal financial ministers; however, he was stuck in the kilometer-long traffic jams that occurred after the accidents and had to cancel his participation at the Vienna consultations.  </field>

<field name="text">At the end of the Bundestag election campaign, Federal Chancellor Kohl and SPD challenger Schroeder have urgently challenged their supporters to fight for every vote. Kohl said in Mainz that the election is a decision for direction. In view of the many global crises, Germany has to continue to be a dependable partner. Schroeder demanded that Kohl be voted out of office. Schroeder called him the Chancellor of unemployment and couldn't achieve social unification of the German Volk. Even the Buendnis 90/Greens, FDP and PDS once again tried to get support for their party with rallys. 60.5 million German citizens are being urged to vote for a new Bundestag in tomorrow's elections. A total of 33 parties with 5062 candidates are competing for Bundestag seats. According to various surveys, many German citizens have not yet decided who they should vote for tomorrow. Bundestag president Suessmuth warned citizens that they should still vote - even if they are still unsure or frustrated.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the "Welt am Sonntag", the Swiss airline Swissair is taking over 49.9% of the airline business of the German tour operator LTU.

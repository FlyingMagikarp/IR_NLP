<field name="text">Government allegedly wants to rid the compulsory unemployment- and pension-insurance schemes of 25 to 30 billion marks worth of tasks they currently are responsible for. According to the newspaper BERLINER ZEITUNG, sales- and excise-duty on motor-spirits will rise to make up shortfalls, and that would have been agreed to by top politicians of the coalition parties and the FDP.  Minister Bluem's proposal to lower pensions from currently 70 to 64% (mainly based on your last pay) until the year 2030, plus granting subsidies to the pension scheme, was discussed by the CDU-party today. Mr Bluem's proposal to set up a so-called family-fund seems to be doomed from the start. Mr Bluem himself is against a so-called basic pension (regardless of contributions). Saxony's state premier Biedenkopf, however, is very much for the latter, and put up more details for discussion. According to him this should replace the existing system.  </field>

<field name="text">Government's plans to cut subsidies for coal-mining raised miners', unions' and the SPD-party's hackles. Miners occupied mines and demonstrated against planned job losses. All mines in the Ruhr and the Saar regions stopped work. The coal-mining states of North-Rhine/Westphalia and Saar asked the federal government to scrap their plans.  </field>

<field name="text">Foreign Minister Kinkel met Israel's head of state Netanyahu and Palestinian head of state Arafat. Mr Netanyahu defended Israel's decision to build a Jewish quarter in the (Arab-controlled) eastern part of Jerusalem. Mr Kinkel, however, confirmed that he had reservations about the matter. This issue re-surfaced in the talks with Mr Arafat, who also criticised Israel's withdrawal from more parts of the West-Jordan region as not being enough.  </field>

<field name="text">Tomorrow is International Women's Day, and politicians and associations asked for more equal treatment of women and men at work and in society. According to the minister, Ms Nolte, there had been progress but there is no reason why we should be content with the actual state of affairs. Unions asked for the distribution of work and income to be more just and respecting the principles of solidarity.  </field>

<field name="text">Nicola Fleuchaus and Susanne Siegfried identified their alleged kidnapper in court. Yesterday Ms Siegfried was cross-examined for almost two hours. She recognised Julio Cesar Vega without fail, but was unable to confirm that the 32-year old man actually was the head of the gang of kidnappers, as police had claimed. She described Mr Vega as her guardian angel, who would have helped her and Ms Fleuchaus save their lives, if the ransom-deal had failed. They also touched on the issue of the photos showing Ms Fleuchaus kissing Mr Vega. "I don't know when Ms Fleuchaus and Mr Vega became more than friendly, though he was the only one to drop his mask as early as 10 days after the kidnapping." In spite of a court summons, Ms Fleuchaus was absent. According to her lawyer, Mr Rilling, she already had made depositions at the Costa Rica embassy in Bonn last May, and identified two perpetrators on photos. She wanted to be left in peace now. And, according to Costa Rican law, she would have had to pay the airfare to Costa Rica herself, which would have been unacceptable.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Benno Buble, former public servant, was taken to court once again for alleged graft. Last October his first trial had been aborted when the public prosecutor had swamped the court with literally last-minute submissions for evidence, wreaking havoc to the court's roster. Mr Buble had been a member of the state lottery's advisory board, and gone on a business-trip to Brussels, together with his wife and other members. At the time Mr Buble had applied for retirement, having learned that the district court would begin investigating the matter. As the business-trip was a bit 'touristy' as well, Mr Buble and other travellers were taken to court. Mr Buble thinks he is not guilty, and the business-trip to Brussels is not a matter for the penal court.  </field>

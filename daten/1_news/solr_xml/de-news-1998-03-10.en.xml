<field name="text">Most of the federal states do not want to deport Albanians from the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo. Especially the SPD-ruled states want to wait and see how the situation develops in Kosovo. They went along with the decision of North-Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony to defer deportations until the end of this week. Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg stressed, however, that they intended to continue with deportation on a case-by-case basis, without directly returning people to Kosovo. The Federal Interior Minister, Kanther, also spoke against a general stop to deportation, saying that the situation in Kosovo was difficult, but that he had no information to suggest that people who had been refused asylum had been subjected to human rights abuse in Yugoslavia.  </field>

<field name="text">In future, sex offenders may have the genetic data of their saliva, sperm or hair logged in a central database, according to the Federal Interior Ministry. Re-offenders could then be identified more swiftly with the help of these genetic fingerprints. Federal Interior Minister, Manfred Kanther, and Federal Justice Minister Schmidt-Jortzig have agreed on a corresponding draft law. The data would be held for up to 20 years.  </field>

<field name="text">The strained relationship between Germany and Turkey has worsened further. The Turkish Foreign Minster Cagar (Sp?) called off his planned visit to Germany today. The reason given was that the long-planned meeting with Federal Labour Minister Bluem had been reduced at the last minute to a lunch. It would not therefore be worth it for Cagar to travel to Germany. The Labour Ministry in Bonn rejected the complaint: it had been mutually agreed that an intensive discussion would follow the lunch. German-Turkish relations had already been strained following Nazi accusations made by the Turkish Minister President Yilmaz last week.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Federation of Union (DGB) has criticized that young women are disfavoured when looking for trainee jobs. Mr. Goerner, member of the DGB executive said girls were more strongly affected by the reduction of trainee jobs than boys. More than half of those who were still looking for a trainee job in January were female although only 49% of all applicants were women. Goerner assumes that the situation will become more serious because this year was the first time that more girls than boys were looking for a trainee job.  </field>

<field name="text">Germany has achieved an important victory in the European Supreme Court regarding the European "banana dispute". The court nullified the EU's approval of a basic treaty with four Central American countries that export bananas. The treaty had put the traditional exporters and thus most of the German importers at a disadvantage. The import of Latin American bananas had been limited and a duty was imposed to promote the sale of bananas from Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean.  </field>

<field name="text">Police and customs have apprehended five persons in the Stuttgart/ Ludwigsburg area who allegedly tricked 1.35 million DM from the tax office. The state criminal police arrested two men and one woman. All five confessed most allegations. Apparently, the group of five had registered several companies with the trade office since July last year. These companies issued each other fake bills. The head of the group then applied for and received a tax return. Money was transferred several times among various accounts as a cover-up. Several banks suspected money laundering and contacted the police.  </field></doc></add>

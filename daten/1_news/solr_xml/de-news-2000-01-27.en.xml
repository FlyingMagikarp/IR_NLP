<field name="text">The Hessian CDU hid more money than the previously revealed 8 million DM in secret accounts in Switzerland. Accountants who have been investigating the finances of the state party have determined that there could be up to 20 million DM in Swiss accounts. The party's state leader and State Premier Roland Koch stated this afternoon that the examiners had discovered the account. In December 1983, a total of 19.2 million DM in cash was withdrawn from the account at the Metallbank; 1.5 million DM was then redeposited in a new account, also at the Metallbank. Koch said further that he had spoken with former CDU state party chairman Manfred Kanther about the discrepancy who also had no explanation for why the amount was more than the 8 million DM he had admitted to.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bundestag committee investigating the CDU donation scandal decided this afternoon when it will hear which witnesses.  The staff of the Chancellor's Office will be questioned first about the disappearance of files on the sale of the Leuna refinery. On March 16, former CDU finance adviser Horst Weyrauch will testify. The SPD, the Greens and the PDS, which make up the majority of the committee, made this decision against the wishes of CDU/CSU representatives, who would rather have had former chancellor Helmut Kohl as the first witness. The government's ruling parties (SPD and Greens) insisted that Kohl testify later, since Kohl still refuses to divulge the names of the donors and is also the target of a criminal investigation in which he can decline to testify. It is planned that Kohl appear in late spring and that he then be confronted with the testimony of earlier witnesses. Former CDU Secretary General Heiner Geissler and former party treasurer Walther Leisler Kiep will likely be called at the beginning of April. Kiep's successor, Brigitte Baumeister, will be called in mid-April.  </field>

<field name="text">After the resignation of North Rhine-Westphalia's finance minister Heinz Schleusser in the wake of the "flight scandal," a successor is to be found as soon as possible. Deputy State Premier Michael Vesper (Greens) does not believe that a decision will be made today. Likely candidates for the position include Federal Finance Ministry Undersecretary Barbara Hendriks, former Berlin Finance Senator Annette Fugmann-Hesing and the State Finance Ministry Undersecretary Ernst Gerlach from Duesseldorf. Schleusser defended his resignation to SPD members this morning. The decisive factor, he said, was that he did not want his private life paraded in public. Participants in the discussion said that no mention was made of lies. For the CDU opposition, the resignation of the finance minister is only the first step. According to CDU state parliamentary party chief Laurents-Meier, they want to get rid of the whole corrupt bunch.  </field>

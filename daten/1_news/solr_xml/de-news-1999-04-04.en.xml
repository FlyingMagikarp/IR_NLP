<field name="text">In the face of the desperate situation of Kosovo refugees, NATO and the European Union have increased the aid they are offering. The NATO Council met with representatives of the EU countries to coordinate their efforts. The EU had previously declared its willingness to accept up to 100,000 Kosovo refugees. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in his capacity as President of the EU Council, made that assurance to the government of Macedonia. The United States and Canada also pledged their support. Turkey offered to take in up to 20,000 refugees; Germany 10,000; Norway 6000; and the United States 20,000. The government of Greece has set up four refugee camps in the central part of the country and on the Peloponnesian peninsula, capable of sheltering 6000 people. However, such announcements do nothing to ease the situation of the refugees in camps like the one at Blace tonight, where 60,000 people, some exhausted, sick, and desperate, face another cold night in the open air. Doctors on the scene are warning of a wave of influenza which began spreading among the refugees today. The German Armed Forces, meanwhile, have initiated their flights of aid for the refugees on a large scale. The first three aircraft took off early this morning. Together with Dutch soldiers, German personnel also prepared a camp for the displaced in Western Macedonia. NATO aircraft flying in aid materials are supposed to be flying out refugees as early as this evening. However, the air corridor has not yet been able to be established. According to the responsible coordinator in the Macedonian government, the designated aircraft could not begin the mission because so far none of the countries willing to accept the refugees had issued landing permits. Only after that could refugees be brought from the camp at Blace, on the Macedonian-Yugoslav border, to the airport, a trip of about three hours.  </field>

<field name="text">German Internal Affairs Minister Otto Schily has described the acceptance of Kosovo refugees in the countries of the EU as the last of several possibilities for aid. Following a visit to Albania, Schily said that on-site aid was the first priority. On an ARD television news program, Schily said "We would, if it became necessary, obviously grant that kind of aid too, but all of the EU Internal Affairs Ministers are agreed that aid at the scene must have priority. Because it can be delivered most quickly there, because it ultimately involves the least effort, and because it is necessary that the people be able to expect a return to the homes they have been driven from as soon as possible."  </field>

<field name="text">Washington DC. The United States wants to send its Apache attack helicopters into Yugoslavia. The Security Advisor to the White House, Sandy Berger, made the official announcement this evening. The low-flying aircraft are considered a most effective weapon for destroying tanks. However, according to military sources, its deployment carries grave risks for the crew aboard. Burger said the move did not mark the beginning of an extended ground engagement in the war.  </field>

<field name="text">The war in Kosovo was a central theme in the Pope's Easter address today. In front of more than 100,000 people at St. Peter's Square in Rome, the head of the Catholic Church condemned the mass expulsion of people in the Balkans. John Paul II appealed directly to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to open a humanitarian corridor in Kosovo to allow the delivery of aid materials. Amid the applause of the faithful, the Pope said "Peace is possible, peace is a duty. Peace is the pre-eminent responsibility of everyone". He also said the diabolic spiral of revenge and senseless fratricidal conflicts must finally be broken. Earlier, the Pope also recited the "Urbi et orbi" blessing and Easter greetings in 61 languages.  </field>

<field name="text">Birmingham, England. Until today, the German Davis Cup team was ahead of Russia 2:1; today it ran out of steam. Neither Tommy Haas nor Nicolas Kiefer had a chance against their quicker Russian opponents today. Yevgeny Kafelnikov, showing no sign of fatigue after his double match yesterday, beat Haas in only an hour and a half, in three straight sets. Kiefer subsequently put up a good fight, but in the end succumbed to the intense pressure that Marat Safin put him under from the start.  </field></doc></add>

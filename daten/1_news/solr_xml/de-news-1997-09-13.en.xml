<field name="text"> At an informal meeting of EU ministers of finance, Minister of Finance Waigel reiterated his demand for lowering the high net contribution to be made by Germany to the EU budget.  At the Luxembourg spa Mondor, he said that the Federal Republic was carrying 60 to 70 per cent of the total net cost of the EU and said that this was not good.  Beginning in the year 2000, Mr.  Waigel wants to reduce the net payments to the EU from the present payment of approximately 22 billion marks by 7 billion marks.  The majority of EU ministers reacted to Mr. Waigel's demand in a reserved manner.  To be sure, the EU commission was asked to present a paper on the topic of contributions with its own figures by October.  Waigel received support for his proposal from the Netherlands which also called for a reduction of their contribution. According to some of the delegates, the president of the EU that if all of them wanted to reduce their contribution, the expansion of the EU would be endangered.  </field>

<field name="text"> In the matter of financing the system of social benefits, BDI President Henkel accused Federal Labor Minister Bluem of deceiving the voters.  Mr. Bluem's proposal that pension structure reform be separated from refinancing was just too much, the BDI chief said.  Mr. Bluem's social benefits policies had not been up to date for a long time, he continued.  There was need for a minister who would find jobs and not just hand out social benefits.  </field>

<field name="text">The projected permanent atomic waste facility "Konrad shaft" in Salzgitter will never be activated.  This is the opinion of Monika Griefhan, Lower Saxony's minister for the environment.  Her point of departure, the SPD politician told the German press agency (dpa) that, even after permission was granted, the facility would not be constructed.  Since there was a sufficient number of intermediate facilities, she continued, there would be no need for energy suppliers to construct a permanent facility.  Ms. Griefhan reiterated her charge that the brawl concerning the Konrad shaft had shown that Bonn was trying to transfer the entire jurisdiction for granting permission for atomic waste facilities to the federal government.  </field>

<field name="text">The Agricultural Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Ms. Hoehn, has stoked the flames of debate over the marking of beef. With the background of the recent import scandal she demanded a certificate of origin not just for meat, but also for sausage wares. A certificate will be required by the EU as of January 1, 2000. Beyond that, Ms. Hoehn advocated more vigorous local marketing. That would make the process more transparent to the consumer. Next week the Federal Agriculture, along with those from the states, will meet in Husum. This topic will probably appear on the agenda there.  </field>

<field name="text">The Telekom corporation, in the wake of the decision of Post Minister Boetsch on the interconnection of telephone networks, is considering a telephone rate increase for connections. According to a spokesman for Telekom, possibilities include an increase in the basic rate or in the access price. At the same time Telekom head Mr. Sommer proposed a reduction, especially for long telephone conversations, in the next year during an interview with the newspaper BILD am Sonntag. The fees would go down about 5 percent. The savings would be more noticeable as the time and distance of calls increased, Sommer said. Local calls would cost the same 12 Pfennigs, and telephone information would become more expensive to compensate. Post Minister Boetsch decided yesterday that Telekom would have to charge significantly less for leasing telephone lines to private competitors than had been asked for.  </field>

<field name="text">Finance minister Lafontaine declared the government was not in a position to establish precise quantification in the matter of reducing unemployment rates. After a meeting of the governing bodies in Bonn, the SPD chairman said there were too many imponderables in the economic situation to allow giving out precise quantification. He conceded having erred in not refuting outright the figure of 3 million unemployed by end 2002 suggested by his interviewer on ZDF-TV.  </field>

<field name="text">Transportation minister Muentefering toned down his remarks on a proposed upper age limit for drivers' licenses today. He had said in a press interview that the same way there was an initial age limit for youngsters he could imagine an upper limit for senior citizens. "I meant to make clear that just as happened with young persons, senior citizens should also reflect on their own fitness for participating in traffic. This varies from individual to individual, but all person have to bear in mind their personal responsibility. When you grow older, you have to be careful about your eyesight and ask yourself whether you are still fit for driving a car. This is in the general interest of all participants in traffic, so it is valid for senior citizens, too." The federal seniors' league showed itself outraged and called the proposal pure nonsense. They treat senior citizens like under-age children in disregard of the fact that young persons are to be blamed for most accidents.  </field>

<field name="text">The chairman of the federal medical association, Vilmar, apologized for his controversial comments on the government coalition's health law plans. He said he meant to make people aware without any intention of frightening would-be patients. His statement that people might die at an earlier age because of the reduction of doctors' fees was meant to be ironic. But it caused a tempestuous uproar of indignation.  </field>

<field name="text">The first round of wage talks between employers and the metal workers' union for Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hesse, Rhineland- Palatinate and Saarland was adjourned until January without any approximation of points of view. Just as they had done in North Rhine-Westphalia last week, the employers did not tender an offer. Their aim is an agreement providing a certain percentile raise and a one-time payment depending on the economic situation of the companies concerned. The metal workers want a 6.5% boost. In the banking sector, there was also no agreement in sight for the 470,000 employees.  </field>

<field name="text">Ignaz Bubis, chairman of Germany's Central Jewish Council, who had accused writer Martin Walser of being a "spiritual incendiary", took back this accusation today, not without the critical remark that Walser, in his acceptance speech for the librarians' peace prize, had expressed himself in a way that could easily be misunderstood. Bubis said this after a personal talk with Walser in Frankfurt/Main. Two months ago, on receiving the prize, Walser had declared - among other matters - that holocaust remembrance must not be instrumentalized and Auschwitz must not be used as a moral blunt instrument.  </field>

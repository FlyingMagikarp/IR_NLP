<field name="text">The SPD federal party congress has been opened today in the capital. Five hundred fifty-two delegates will elect a new executive board and president by Thursday. The Social-Democrats also want to adopt a new course in economics and tax politics. Deputy party president and Bundestag president Wolfgang Thierse referred in his opening speech to the CDU donation affaire saying that, today, people were wondering more than ever whether they could trust in politics. Chancellor Schroeder was even more pointed. In his opening speech the Chancellor also defended his support for the shaky Holzmann group. Politics must always act when a large company falls into a crisis by mismanagement. Another topic of his speech was the Alliance for Employment. The Chancellor expects concrete results for the Alliance at its next meeting. In the afternoon, the party had adopted a motion to create this office. Franz Muentefering was elected first secretary-general of the party at the congress with 94.2 percent of the votes. Chancellor Schroeder was re-elected as eighth president in the SPD's history with surprisingly high 86.3 percent of the votes. Four of his deputies were re-elected: Bundestag President Wolfgang Thierse, Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Bavaria's SPD president Renate Schmidt and Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping. Wolfgang Clement was elected fifth deputy.  </field>

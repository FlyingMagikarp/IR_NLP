<field name="text">Finance Minister Lafontaine and Environment Minister Trittin defended their draft for an ecological tax-reform in parliament. During the first reading they spoke of a long overdue change of direction. Now, compulsory contributions to the state-run pension scheme may be lowered by .8% as of 1 April 1999, and that's when fuel tax will go up. The opposition parties would have nothing of that, and called the eco-tax useless. They mainly criticised that exemptions for certain businesses had been made on a completely arbitrary basis. FDP-member Thiele said that Germany had forged ahead without checking with any of the other EU-partners. Head of the PDS parliamentary group Gysi said that government's plans were neither okay from a social viewpoint nor did they make sense. Granting exemptions to companies who used a lot of energy, would be utter rubbish.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder's announcement that he wanted to reform the taxation and contributions for the so-called casual jobs keeps drawing criticism. Employees' union DAG compared it to selling a parcel containing little goods yet plenty of (hot) air. The HBV union said that the chance to put a stop to the avoidance of social security contributions had been missed. Employers, however, were quite happy with the new system. Now the threshold will be 620 marks/month (used to be 590 for East Germany only). Instead of paying a set percentage in tax, employers now will have to pay contributions to the public health-insurance and pension funds. Employees, however, will gain no entitlements from health/pension insurance. Several states now decided that they wanted compensation for the resulting shortfall in taxes, and referred to relevant consultations in the Upper House (Bundesrat)  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder admitted that he had made some errors during his first few weeks in office. His biggest error would have been that he placed too much emphasis on speed, as far as some issues were concerned. In an interview with the ARD network he admitted that it was perfectly okay that the new government copped some flak for that. He defended his plans for a reform of the so-called casual jobs: Finance Minister Lafontaine had taken part in all the meetings and had made clear that the plan was feasible. Mr Schroeder refuted Mr Lafontaine's proposal to change unemployment insurance to a solely tax-based system. Apart from that, Mr Schroeder emphasised that he would not exclude cuts to the social system.  </field>

<field name="text">In the future the state governments of North-Rhine/Westphalia and Bavaria want to co-operate closely, as far as European and financial policies are concerned. That's what the two state premiers, Messrs Clement, SPD, and Stoiber, CSU, declared in Dusseldorf. After three hours of talks they said that states also had to put a stamp on Germany's future development as well as Europe's.  </field>

<field name="text">The domestic secret service (Verfassungsschutz) will keep an eye on the Scientology Organisation and the PDS party, according to Internal Affairs Minister Schily, SPD, who had just finished meeting with the state ministers in Bonn. There still were doubts about the constitutionality, the goals and the structure of the PDS. Observation, however, would not involve secret service methods, as Mr Schily emphasised. Only a few days ago Mr Schily had stated that there would have to be a rethink about the observation of the PDS-party - in view of the recent coalition in the state of Mecklenburg- Western Pomerania (SPD-PDS).  </field>

<field name="text">State and federal environment ministers asked for higher safety standards for sea traffic in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. And apart from that, shipping lines should be made responsible for damages in the future, according to Baden-Wuerttemberg's Mr Mueller. Emergency and rescue services have now started pumping oil from the tanker 'Pallas' (which had beached close to the island of Amrum, in the North Sea). They had done so in spite of a small fire on board that had not been put out yet, according to a spokesperson for the environment minister in Kiel. As heat had not been as intense as expected they had been able to start draining the oil earlier than planned.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">The Krupp-Hoesch company and Thyssen Ltd. want to jointly found a steel company and in this way get around Krupp's planned take-over of Thyssen. The goal is evidently to work out a concept for cooperating in the steel industry, within 8 days. During this period, Krupp will delay its hostile takeover bid. This announcement was made today in Duesseldorf by the government of North Rhine-Westphalia and the two companies. Executives from both companies agreed to the plan yesterday evening at a meeting with state Premier Rau. Chancellor Kohl had called on Krupp and Thyssen to find a reasonable solution to their dispute, in the interests of all Germans. Protests by the employees at both companies continue. More than 10,000 workers at Thyssen gathered in Duisburg to discuss measures to be taken against the takeover. According to the employees' factory committee, workers at Krupp-Hoesch also laid down their work and stopped production.  </field>

<field name="text">The CDU wants to retain the pension system in which payments are financed by contributions; the party also wants to make some corrections to the system. Delegates at a mini party convention have come to this decision, accepting the course suggested by Employment Minister Bluem with a large majority. Bluem's concept basically takes into account increasing life expectancies in future pension calculations, so that the payment rate will gradually fall to 64 percent of a person's last net income. Premier Biedenkopf of Saxony did not present his alternative model, of a basic pension level financed by tax revenues, for official consideration. His request that the party put off its decision for a few months did not receive the support of a majority of delegates.  </field>

<field name="text">The resumption of talks on tax reform between the Coalition and the SPD is evidently in doubt. SPD leader Lafontaine sent a letter to Chancellor Kohl, demanding that contributions to unemployment insurance and the federal pension plan be lowered by 2 percent each as of July 1 of this year. He said that in compensation, the value-added tax and the oil tax should be increased, and the decrease in the Solidarity Supplement, which is already on the books and due to go into force on January 1, 1998, should be cancelled. In Chancellor Kohl's written response to the letter, he declines a personal meeting with Lafontaine. Kohl did emphasize that negotiations between the Coalition and the SPD should be resumed as quickly as possible, but he only offered to set up a meeting between Lafontaine and Finance Minister Waigel in the next few days. Kohl also rejected Lafontaine's demand that the coalition make concrete suggestions before the talks are resumed. In an initial reaction to Kohl's letter, the SPD has said its members must discuss whether there is any sense now in resuming the talks at all. The SPD had broken off the talks because of the government's policies regarding coal mining.  </field>

<field name="text">The German construction industry is an another year of recession, according to the employers' association. The industry expects to have to cut another 74,000 jobs. President of the association, Franz, complained especially of a fall-off of construction investments in the East. He also said that, besides the consequences of an economic downturn, German construction companies also had to deal with increasing competition from low-wage companies from abroad. The Bundestag held a special sitting this afternoon to discuss the situation of the construction industry. Spokesmen from the Government and the Opposition condemned the illegal employment of foreigners for very low wages on German construction sites. The SPD called for tougher penalties for violators. The party also accused the Government of failing to deal with the matter.  </field>

<field name="text">The Hesse Administrative Court has begun hearings on the continued operation of the Biblis nuclear power plant. The court will rule on the case of municipalities and private citizens against the reactor's operation. They want it shut down because of inadequate fire protection and a construction insufficient to withstand earthquakes and possible airplane crashes. The company operating the plant, RWE, considers the charges invalid. The formal opponent of the plaintiffs in this trial is the State of Hesse, represented by the Ministry for the Environment, led by the Green Party. In principle, both sides in the trial agree with one another: Hesse has already tried 3 times to shut down one block of Biblis, but the Federal Environment Ministry rejected the closure.  </field>

<field name="text">The debts held by federal, state, and local governments in Germany have sky-rocketed in the last several years. According to the Federal Bank, public debt more than doubled between 1989 and 1996. The debt load now stands at over 2 trillion Marks.

<field name="text">The Italian government has proclaimed an emergency situation in all of Italy, because of the continuing flow of refugees from Albania into the country. The proclamation allows the government to have access to additional funds and to prepare emergency shelter for the refugees more quickly. Authorities can now also send back any of the refugees who threaten the public order in Italy. In Bonn, Federal Internal Affairs Minister Kanther instructed German border guards to institute tighter security at German borders, given the situation in Albania. Bavarian Internal Affairs Minister Beckstein has also already ordered tighter controls at the state's borders. The state government has indicated that there are approximately 1,500 officials in place to prevent illegal entry. Beckstein said on North German Radio that efforts should be made to distribute the burden evenly. He reminded listeners that there are up to 15,000 Albanian refugees in Italy now, while Germany alone took in more than 300,000 Bosnian refugees earlier.  </field>

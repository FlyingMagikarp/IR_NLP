<field name="text">A few hours before the EU summit talks on employment were to begin, more than 20,000 persons from almost all EU member nations joined in a demonstration against unemployment. They had been called up by the European federation of unions. The demonstrators called on Chiefs of State and government heads to agree on concrete steps towards job creation and security. The Chiefs of State and government heads of the European Union will assemble today and tomorrow to discuss ways leading out of the prevailing situation of mass unemployment. According to official reports, there are over 18 million unemployed EU-wide. The special meeting stems from an effort by France's leftist government. Luxembourg's government head and European Council president Juncker says this should not be a "summit of literary academicians" leading to uncompromising resolutions. Most EU governments agree. Immediately before the special summit, European socialist leaders had a meeting chaired by German SPD parliamentary leader Rudolf Scharping to coordinate their strategies. None of Europe's social democratic governments is in favour of establishing employment guidelines on paper, said Scharping, and the SPD agrees. Just like the EU-Commission and the Luxembourg council president, the social democrats want the summit participants to agree on concrete aims. The employment summit began belatedly due to fog and icy rainfalls in France.  </field>

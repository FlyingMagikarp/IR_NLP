<field name="text">The EU-heads of state agreed to a compact on stability for the planned setting-up of the European Currency Union. According to the agreement, countries whose budget deficits are too high, will have to pay a penalty. The compromise they agreed to in Dublin, however, also provides for exceptions, in case a country suffers a major recession during more than one year causing gross domestic product (GDP) to shrink by more than .75%. This compact had been proposed by German Federal Minister of Finance, Mr Waigel, a year ago. After agreement had been reached in Dublin, Mr Waigel said that this would indicate quite clearly that the Euro would become a strong currency. Today the future Euro-banknotes were presented for the first time. They are to feature the different architectural styles used in Europe.  </field>

<field name="text">An overwhelming majority of members of parliament voted for another deployment of German armed forces in Bosnia (some 3,3000 soldiers), serving under SFOR. Government and opposition party SPD agreed that Germany had to do more to guarantee peace in Bosnia. Last night the UN Security Council had given the green light for a 30,000 strong SFOR contingent. The deployment is to last 18 months.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr Joschka Fischer, of the Greens/Alliance90 party, accused the government of trying to assign the German armed forces duties beyond NATO-boundaries. He pleaded for leaving the soldiers in Bosnia, but they should get a proper UN-mandate for the job.  Defence Minister Ruehe vigorously opposed this claim: such a mandate would entail battle-orders, and the latter would be far more dangerous to German soldiers. At the same time, Mr Ruehe declared that the German armed forces brief had in fact changed, as they would at long last be on equal footing with the other NATO-soldiers.  </field>

<field name="text">The public prosecutor in Darmstadt will take Mr Lopez, former head of purchasing at Volkswagen, to court. He is alleged to have broken industrial confidentiality and to have embezzled confidential documents. Investigations, however, could not tell if Volkswagen did know about these matters. Volkswagen now think that this confirms that there had been no collusion by their CEO's, and no damage was done to GM/Opel, and that's why they assume their chances for an out-of-court settlement are getting better (instead of fighting it out in a US-court where GM was claiming damages). Volkswagen representatives expect a meeting between themselves and GM as early as around Christmas. Today's news from the public prosecutor would have paved the way for such a move, and head of VW, Mr Piech, allegedly already is in the US. Opel, however, said that Volkswagen tried to brush aside the criminal-law accusations against Mr Lopez: VW would not yet be in the clear.  </field>

<field name="text">After a third round of talks, the state premiers of Rhine-land/Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg declared that the talks about reorganising public radio in the south-western part of Germany should be finished by autumn 1997. The next meeting will be on 23 January, and it should also include the directors of Suedwestfunk, Mr Voss, and his counterpart at Sueddeutscher Rundfunk, Mr Fuenfgeld. There also was some progress as far as the membership of future committees was concerned. Out of 10 members of the administrative committee, 7 should be from Baden-Wuerttemberg whereas 3 would be Rhine-land/Palatinate members. The future 'Rundfunkrat' is to have 60 members.  </field>

<field name="text">Karlsruhe police arrested a gang specialising in robbing automatic teller-machines (ATM's) and cash-dispensers. The perpetrators are alleged to have netted more than 500,000 marks during recent raids. The 4 criminals, aged between 26 and 46 years, allegedly broke into at least 12 ATM's situated in banks' foyers. On 14 June 1996, late at night, the well-organised gang broke into the Gruenwettersbach branch office, near Karlsruhe. As always, the gang-members (who are no strangers to police and courts) picked a branch office in a rural area, relatively far from the next police station. They gained access to the foyer using a credit-card. So far, however, not a single banknote of the loot has been found.  </field></doc></add>

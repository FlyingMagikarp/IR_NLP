<field name="text">While the official job market statistics for August are not scheduled to be released before next week, some preliminary estimates are now available. The German Press Agency is reporting no change in the previously high unemployment rate. These figures could put a damper on the efforts of the federal government four weeks before the Bundestag election. In August, over four million people were still jobless. These findings are due to a first analysis of the most recent statistics by the Federal Labor Office. Although the figures will be officially publicized on September 8th, the German Press Agency reported on them today. According to the report, approximately 4.1 million jobless were recorded in August, as many as in July. Federal Chancellor Kohl stated in an interview that he assumes that the unemployment rate will reach the magic number of under four million in the next few weeks. Prospects for the apprentice training market continue to be dim. According to Bernhard Jagoda, Present of the Federal Institute of Labor, an additional 20,000 to 25,000 positions are still needed.In comparison to 1997, there were 0.7% less positions offered while there was a 3.1% increase in the number of applicants.  </field>

<field name="text">Parties have begun running for Bundestag mandates. The FDP has followed the lead of the other parties represented in the Bundestag and have turned up the heat in the final election phase by holding a special party congress in Bonn's Beethovenhalle. Following the usual practice at such gatherings, party head Gerhardt harshly attacked his political opponents. The one-day special party congress culminated in a declaration of the party's election objectives. The party called for a massive tax reform, a reform of the education system, and the continuation of an established foreign policy under Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. According to FDP General Secretary Westerwelle, the social welfare system also must be reworked.  Mr. Gerhardt added that it would only be possible to prevent a change in power in government if the FDP were able to take over the position as the third strongest party from the Greens. A major second ballot campaign would bring the FDP the results it hopes for. Party head Gerhardt is working to receive a minister appointment in the new government.  </field>

<field name="text">The CeBit Home multimedia fair was the talk of the town for five days in Hanover. Exhibitors demonstrated innovations in the areas of computer, Internet, and cellular technology. Some 200,000 visitors were expected at the second CeBit Home, 10,000 less than two years ago. The German Trade Fair Association has not yet confirmed whether this goal was achieved. At any rate, there were approximately fifty less exhibitors at this fair compared to the one held in 1996, resulting in a lot of unoccupied space in the exhibition hall. The numbers of area specialists visiting the fair surpassed the forecasts. In the year 2000, the next CeBit Home multimedia fair will take place in Leipzig because the exhibition center in Hanover will be occupied at that time by the World Exposition.  </field>

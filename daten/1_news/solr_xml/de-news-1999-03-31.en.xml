<field name="text">General Naumann, chairman of NATO's military committee, ruled out a suspension of military action against Yugoslavia over Easter. It would be inhuman to consider such a thing, said Naumann this evening from Brussels. A break in the hostilities would be license for Serbian President Milosevic to continue his campaign of murder and expulsion. Naumann admitted that the attacks by the alliance would not prevent Serbian police units from pursuing Kosovars. They can however destroy military targets from the air. Yesterday, the NATO council authorized General Clarke, the European Commander-in-Chief, to increase the intensity of military strikes against targets in Yugoslavia. From Washington, US government spokesperson Lockhardt said Belgrade's policy of ethnic cleansing has placed Kosovo's status vis-a-vis Serbia increasingly in question. He made it clear that the American President continues to oppose the use of ground troops. In Kosovo, the systematic expulsion of the Albanian population continues. According to NATO reports, Serbian police have been firing on refugees with heavy weapons. Eye witnesses report mass deportations to the border. The alliance has accused the Serbian armed forces of targeting birth and residence records of the Albanian population for destruction. At the Macedonian border today, the arriving refugees were still being processed slowly. According to statements by Deputy Foreign Minister Verheugen, the atrocities in Kosovo were carefully planned in advance by Yugoslav President Milosevic. Verheugen, at a press conference in the Albanian capital of Tirana, said he saw no alternative to continuing the air attacks. Demonstrations welcoming NATO military action took place in Bonn, Duesseldorf and Stuttgart. Altogether about 6000 Albanians took part in the demonstrations.  </field>

<field name="text">The BMW automobile company of Munich and the British government have agreed in principle on support for Rover, an English subsidiary of BMW. British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced from London that Minister of Industry Byers and BMW head Milberg have also come to an agreement on the level of the subsidies. According to a spokesperson for BMW, the subsidies have ensured that production of a new model of the Rover will take place in Longbridge. The parties involved have agreed to keep the amount of subsidies under wraps. According to BMW, it must still be approved by the company's executive committee as well as by the EU. The automaker has previously threatened to move future production of the Rover line of autos to Hungary. If that had happened, almost 10,000 Rover employees in Longbridge would have lost their jobs.  </field></doc></add>

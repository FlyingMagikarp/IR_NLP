<field name="text">Harald Juhnke considers himself victim of a campaign to damage his reputation. The actor has firmly denied accusations of having called a black guard in Hollywood a "dirty nigger who would have been gassed under Hitler" [translated back from German]. "I have never ever said this", Mr Juhnke stressed.  The black guard who was allegedly insulted by Harald Juhnke will not file charges against the actor. For Mr Juhnke's lawyer the case is clear: even though his client was drunk, he could never have made racist remarks because Mr Juhnke is known for being extremly open-minded and liberal.  Meanwhile, the Berlin Prosecutor's Office is looking at whether Mr Juhnke's remark is punishable by law. So far they have not come up yet with a concrete result. A prosecutor's spokes-person said it was not clear yet whether this might lead to an official investigation.  </field>

<field name="text">Politicians from the CDU and CSU parties fear a deficit of several billion DM in the Federal budget because of the high unemployment rate. CDU financial expert, Mr Austermann, predicts deficits of five billion marks not being covered by the budget, reports the tabloid BILD. FDP budget expert, Mr Koppelin (sp?), said that Finance Minister Theo Waigel might freeze all budgetary spending as early as next week. This, however, would not be enough. In Mr Koppelin's opinion, Mr Waigel will not be able to rebalance the budget without further cuts of, for example, unemployment benefits. This would become absolutely clear in May at the latest, when the next revenue forecast will come out.  </field>

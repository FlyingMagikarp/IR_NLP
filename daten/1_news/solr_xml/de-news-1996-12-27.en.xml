<field name="text">Vast stretches of Europe will remain under the influence of cold winter-weather, and Met-service forecasters predict that it will stay very cold for another week. They also expect snow-falls. Currently the lowest night-time temperatures are around the -20 degrees Celsius mark, in Bavaria.  There were reports of damages by frozen water-pipes, causing, for example, about a million marks worth of damage to the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of Revenue's offices.  </field>

<field name="text">The outgoing president of the EU-parliament, Mr Hentsch, told the heads of states of the EU member-countries that they had neglected employment-policies. Mr Hentsch, a SPD-politician, said in an interview with Radio Bremen, that so far they had paid too little attention to the future of work. New forms of distribution of work were called for.

<field name="text">Mr Schulte, head of the German Council of Trade Unions, asked for less overtime, more part-time work and a levy for education/training. In an interview with the German press agency dpa, Mr Schulte said that German employers would be able to create several 100,000 jobs if they agreed to cut down on overtime, and it was a disgrace if they did not take up the chance to do so.  And more part-time work was needed as well. Employers, however, would not want to know about new concepts as far as working-hours were concerned. Mr Schulte also reminded employers that they should offer more apprenticeships.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Rentpayers' Association is afraid there will be an above-average rise in rents next year. Their director, Mr Rips, said in a newspaper-interview that he would expect more than a third of all households to spend more than 35% of their incomes on rent. Rising rents and very hefty increases in fees collected by the towns and cities were to blame. He would expect the cost of renting to rise at least twice as fast as 'ordinary' inflation.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Taxpayers' Union proposed to have the decision if a person should pay tax, depend on their nationality, according to spokes-person Mr Ondratschek. Well-heeled German nationals then would be unable to escape the tax-man by taking up residence outside Germany. Although there would be more paperwork involved, the revenue office should do it, to be fair to all.  </field>

<field name="text">Germany is importing more and more and more fireworks: according to the Federal Department of Statistics, last year's imports were in excess of 23,000 (metric) tons, the bulk originating from China.  Before the current year is out, organisations supporting the hungry, children and animals appealed to people to spend less on fireworks this New Year's Eve. Their motto, "bread instead of bangers" (Brot anstatt Boeller), is not meant to be a wet blanket; it should, however, be food for thought, and make people wonder if they should not donate part of their money to projects in under-developed countries.  </field></doc></add>

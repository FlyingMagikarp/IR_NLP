<field name="text">He had never been that blunt before, but today Russian president Yeltsin took the cake when speaking out against NATO's airstrikes. In case Yugoslavia got invaded by ground-troops and the invaders set up a 'protectorate' there, Russia would intervene, according to agency reports. Mr Yeltsin said on television that he had warned NATO, the Americans and the Germans that there could be a European or even World War if his country got dragged into the conflict.  The US, however, stated that high-ranking Moscow officials had reassured them once again on Friday afternoon, that they would not intervene. Meanwhile NATO spokesperson Shea told Russia that NATO did not plan an invasion of the Kosovo.  </field>

<field name="text">Last Thursday a bomb hit a residential area in the provincial capital of Pristina, according to NATO. Airforce Commander Wilby stated that the precision device had been deflected and therefore had hit houses some 200 to 300 metres from the intended target (the central telephone exchange). He said he was sorry, though there was no way NATO could be responsible for all the damage caused in Pristina's residential areas, as Serb leaders claimed.  </field>

<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder once again declined to send ground-troops to the Balkan. In a recent interview on television he stated that government saw no reason why they should change their current strategy, and that was it. Defence Minister Scharping and Foreign Minister Fischer agreed. General Naumann, head of the German NATO military committee, said that sending ground-troops still was a theoretical option. Politicians would have to decide on that, after evaluating the situation.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Environment Minister Trittin has halted work on a 14-million mark study about nuclear power-plants using pressurised water for cooling. He said that there was no need for this project any more, as nuclear power generation was on its way out in Germany. The paper was meant to develop safety requirements for future nuclear power-plants. Since 1989 both France and Germany had been involved in the project.  </field></doc></add>

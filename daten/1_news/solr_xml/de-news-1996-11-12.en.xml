<field name="text">The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe has found that top politicians of the former German Democratic Republic may be sentenced by courts of the Federal Republic of Germany for shoot-to-kill commands at the border between both German countries. The eight judges agreed unanimously that the former members of the National Defence Council, Mr. Albrecht, Mr. Kessler, and Mr. Strelitz, could not invoke the principle of international immunity as former heads of government. Neither could they assume that they could not be sentenced by Federal-German courts because GDR border practices agreed with contemporary GDR command structure. It was a most severe wrong to set political aims higher than the individual's right to life by ordering East-German border guards to kill border trespassers when the guards were in doubt whether trespassers could not be stopped otherwise. The commands severely contradicted internationally accepted Basic and Human Rights. The principle of the German constitution that offenses cannot be punished retroactively was not applicable to such obvious Human Rights violations but applied only to the penal code established under principles of democracy, of separation of powers, and the commitment to the Basic Rights. The accused had been sentenced by the Berlin Regional Court in September 1993 to between four-and-a-half and seven-and-a-half years in prison for incitement to manslaughter of refugees. The charge of a former GDR border guard who had been sentenced for manslaughter was also turned down by the judges. In doing so they confirmed the finding that the Federal High Court had put forward in numerous proceedings.  </field>

<field name="text">Bergner, deputy CDU president, has called upon the Liberals to withdraw their demands to reduce the solidarity tax. Bergner said in a newspaper interview the Liberals should not keep calling out rates that later could not be fulfilled. He advocated not to specify a certain rate during deliberations of the tax reform. This morning the heads of the coalition parties met again in the Chancellor's Office to talk about the 1997 federal budget. Last night the Bundestag factions of CDU/CSU and FDP had approved budget cuts of DM3 billion, DM1bn alone was cut from the Federal Labour Office's budget. On the ARD TV morning show CDU welfare expert Heiner Geissler stressed this did not mean that unemployment benefits would be cut. The savings would be made in other areas. Coalition budget experts will deal today with further budget details. Finance Minister Theo Waigel stated that the 1997 budget was based on new debts of [only] DM56.5 billion. Thus, Germany is fulfilling the criteria for the European Monetary Union. In a newspaper interview, Secretary of the Chancellor's Office Friedrich Bohl expressed the opinion that the government coalition was strengthened after the budget deliberations.  </field>

<field name="text">Construction workers employed in other EU states working on German sites must be paid German minimum wages starting January. The wage committee of the Labour Ministry agreed to make the construction industry's collective agreement generally binding until the end of August 1997. The step allows a law to become effective that is to prevent wage dumping. The law is limited until the end of August 1997. The minimum wages, DM17 in West Germany and DM15.64 in East Germany, are to protect German construction workers from cheap foreign competition. Labour Minister Norbert Bluem said that fair competition was now back to German construction sites. There would be strict controls to ensure like wage for like work.  </field>

<field name="text">The prosecutors have begun their final arguments in the so-called Mykonos trial. The five accused have allegedly murdered three oppositional Kurdish-Iranian politicians and their translator in September 1992 in the Berlin restaurant Mykonos. Mr. Justice Bruno Jost accused Iran of state terrorism. Iran had cold-bloodedly ordered the murder of the four men in Berlin and now tries to cover up its involvement in the murder as best as it can. However, Iran would not succeed to force a sentence that does not reveal these links. The prosecutors are convinced that the religious and political leadership of Iran gave the orders for the attack on the restaurant.  </field>

<field name="text">The newly elected mayor of Stuttgart, Mr. Schuster, said the fusion of the two public broadcasters Sueddeutscher Rundfunk and Suedwestfunk must not happen at the expense of the state capital. He continues that Stuttgart was a good place for media as communication technology, large publishing houses, and Sueddeutscher Rundfunk as a strong broadcaster were all present. CDU politician Schuster also advocated to seat the future director of the two-state broadcaster in Stuttgart. Important programmes and editorial staff of Sueddeutscher Rundfunk had to stay in the Baden-Wuerttemberg capital.

<field name="text">The Social-Democrats do not assume that the coalition will break after the latest quarrels within the Christian-Liberal coalition. SPD faction head Rudolf Scharping, talking to journalists in Bonn, said his aim for the SPD was to cut off well at the next federal elections. Since the change of the SPD presidency about one year ago the SPD had stabilized and had good chances to become strongest party in two years. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel strongly criticized the quarrels within the coalition. The former FDP secretary-general stated in an interview with the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung "the small-minded cackling not supporting the welfare of citizens and state must stop!"  </field>

<field name="text">Swiss food group Nestle wants to market genetically engineered food as soon as possible. Concerned brands are Maggi and Nestle cornflake products. Genetically engineered products will also be added to baby food of the Alete brand. Mr. Maucher, head of Nestle said the genetically engineered food had to be introduced quickly so one could see the consumers' reaction. Maucher is convinced that food with altered genes will soon be part of everyday-life. "Even the upset discussion in Germany won't change that". Other large food companies take a wait-and-see approach. E.g., Kraft-Jacobs-Suchard in Bremen has promised that no genetically engineered products are being used in the Miracoli, Kaba, and Milka brands in Europe.  </field></doc></add>

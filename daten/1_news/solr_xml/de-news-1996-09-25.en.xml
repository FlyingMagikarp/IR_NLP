<field name="text">Employers and unions have come to an agreement on new wage contracts in Bremen and Hesse. In the new deal, employees will continue to receive full pay even if sickness keeps them from working. Both sides also agreed to a 1.85 percent wage hike. For the longer store hours which become possible starting in November, employees will receive extra time off: 20 percent more than they put in during the extended hours. However, the first Saturday of each month does not qualify for this bonus in Hesse; in Bremen, two Saturdays each month are exempt. The two states thus follow the example of the agreement reached in North-Rhine-Westfalia last week.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Health Minister Seehofer has defended the planned third stage of health reform against criticism from insurance companies and unions. The government's plans are a precedent-setting response to the challenges facing state-approved health insurance, Seehofer said. He explained that it would become more difficult for insurance companies to raise premiums because of their own economic inefficiency. However, rates could be increased for the sake of the advancement of medicine or because of the aging of the population. The changes are expected to pass quickly through the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, and to be in force early in 1997. According to Seehofer, health insurance companies will largely be allowed to set their own rates. If a company raises its premiums, however, the policy holders' percent excess will automatically increase. The consumer would be permitted to change insurance company on short notice in the event of rate hikes. The state-approved insurance companies and the German Federation of Unions, on the other hand, complained that the planned changes did not address the causes of sky-rocketing health costs, but would effectively only shift the burden to the consumers. They accused the government of losing sight of the basic tenets of socially-viable health insurance.  </field>

<field name="text">After the sexual assault and murder of a seven-year-old girl, the federal government is considering additional types of therapy for sex offenders. Justice Minister Schmid-Jortzig said that a policy of bringing in an external expert in cases of early release from prison was also worth considering. On the whole, the minister defended Germany's justice system against accusations that its treatment of sex offenders was too lax. Early release is not the rule by any means, he said. He also indicated that probationary release could be tied to certain conditions which could minimize the likelihood of another offence, although, on principle, that possibility could not be ruled out. The justice minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, Goll, voiced his opposition to "chemical castration", saying that the important thing was the psychological counselling of offenders during their sentence. More than 600 people took part in the funeral service for the seven-year-old girl, named Natalie, in Epfach this afternoon. The service was broadcast outside the church by speakers. The Archbishop of Augsburg, Schmidt, said that this crime left everyone stunned.  </field>

<field name="text">There are no further obstacles to German Foreign Minister Kinkel's planned visit to China, the official Chinese news agency says. According to the agency, the Chinese foreign minister, Chien, and Kinkel have agreed to gloss over differences of opinion concerning human rights in their talks. Kinkel's visit had been planned for June, but was cancelled after the Bundestag criticized China's policies regarding Tibet. A visit to China by German President Herzog was also thrown into doubt. The news agency now reports that China welcomes Herzog and is looking forward to Kinkel's visit; although the two countries still disagree on matters of human rights, dialogue is more valuable than confrontation  </field>

<field name="text">The union for metal, engineering, and electronics will not accept cuts to sick pay. Starting tomorrow, there will be protests in the work place. In conjunction with other unions, the union is calling for action at both state and federal levels. The chairman of the Baden-Wurttemberg branch of the union, Zambelli, announced "strife at the work site", blaming employers for this escalation because of breach of contract. He named the Daimler-Benz company, which is going to reduce sick pay as of 1 October, as the spearhead of the contract-breakers. The factory committee at Daimler-Benz is calling for no more overtime or extra shifts to be worked, in reaction to the cuts. In the Mercedes-Benz car production plant in Sindelfingen, the factory committee terminated the agreement governing extra shifts. Talks on savings in the company's truck production plants were broken off. This evening there were already work stoppages at Mercedes-Benz. Daimler-Benz was the first company in its industry to announce that it would be cutting sick pay as of 1 October. The designated company president, Hundt, greeted the decision as precedent-setting. Since then, other companies have made similar announcements - such as Siemens, BASF, and Hoechst. Volkswagen and Preussag, on the other hand, are planning of maintaining full sick pay.  </field>

<field name="text">The trial in a case of arson at a refugee residence in Lubeck has been interrupted after one of the plaintiffs fainted while giving testimony. An argument between other plaintiffs and the family of the accused, Eid, ensued. The court adjourned until next Monday. Earlier, a motion by the defence, to cease proceedings, had been rejected. The chief judge based that decision on procedural requirements which had not been met. The lawyer of the accused had argued that the public prosecutor could not prove Eid's guilt, and had referred to contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution's main witness.  </field>

<field name="text">The Schuermann Building in the government quarter of Bonn is now expected to cost much more than the federal government had anticipated. According to the German press agency Deutsche Pressenagentur, reports from the Finance and the Building and Construction Ministries indicate that renovating the severely water-damaged building will cost more than 760 million Marks. 370 million Marks have already been put into the building, which the broadcaster Deutsche Welle is supposed to move into at the end of 1999, leading to a total cost of more than 1.1 billion Marks. The Bundestag's budget committee had allotted 580 million Marks for the renovation project.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">Germany and France agreed that they still disagreed - after meeting at Poitiers to discuss their viewpoints regarding the compact for stability (for the future common European currency). France's PM Chirac stated that both countries' opinions did not differ all that much. Germany's Chancellor Kohl emphasised that he was certain both sides would be able to solve issues that had not been solved so far. At the same time he said that Germany would not agree to amendments to the compact for stability. France's premier Jospin had asked for an addendum covering measures against unemployment. Mr Kohl also said that they would continue negotiations right through the weekend. The Netherlands had come up with a compromise that should also please France: the paper, which was leaked in Brussels, provided for closer co-operation as far as employment policies were concerned, yet at the same time backed Germany's stance, viz. that it was primarily the member states' responsibility to create jobs.  </field>

<field name="text">Germany's state ministers of finance are not too sure about Germany becoming a member of the new common European currency. After their conference in Bad Homburg, they were afraid Germany might not meet the criteria. Excessive deficits and additional debt are on the cards for 1997 and 1998. The state ministers mainly criticised how federal finance minister Waigel handled things: privatisations would only provide a short-term stop-gap measure to fight budget-deficits. Continued cost-cutting/saving money would be a long-term fix, and tax-exemptions/subsidies would have to go as well. They also pleaded for lowering Germany's contributions to the European Community, which they thought were too high.  </field>

<field name="text">The state ministers meeting at Norderney wanted to stick to two days vocational training/week, contrary to what business wanted, according to Hesses's minister Holzapfel. One day less would lower standards, and besides, the current 12 hours training/week would not fit into one day. Federal science and technology minister Ruettgers criticised the decision and blamed the SPD for leaving apprentices out in the cold. "If you are against restructuring vocational training, which would help business, you'll make sure there won't be additional apprenticeships." State and federal heads of state will discuss the issue at the beginning of July.  </field>

<field name="text">EU and USA agreed to recognising each other's product standards, consequently doing away with any technical checks on imports, according to a EU-spokesperson. This would cover goods to the tune of almost 70 billion marks, mainly in the telecommunication, pharmaceutical and electrical appliance sectors. The agreement provides, amongst other things, that EU safety-tests would also be good for the USA.  </field>

<field name="text">This was the first time a lay assessor got sentenced to 3 years'jail, for corruption. The Tiergarten Regional Court stated the sentence had to be a deterrent, as the defendant has willingly broken one of the tenets of a state based on law and order: the independence of judges. The court was convinced the 51-year old real estate salesperson had asked for 100,000 marks to 'tweak' trials.  </field>

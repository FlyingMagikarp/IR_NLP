<field name="text">Continuous rainfall in the past two days has led to the worst floods in years in the Alps foothills in Bavaria, and in Austria and Switzerland.  Two men drowned in a flooded basement in Bavaria.  Whole communities are isolated, entire streets are impassable, and local drinking water has become contaminated.  The fire and police departments, the Red Cross, and the technical assistance were working at full force.  There are also high flood waters in Austria and Switzerland. After several mudslides and heavy flooding occurred in Tirol and Vorarlberg, emergency alarms were sounded.  The situation is equally bad in parts of central and eastern Switzerland.  </field>

<field name="text">NATO is hoping for a rapid conclusion to the Kosovo conflict.  NATO spokesperson Mr. Shea stated in Brussels that the Alliance would like to force the Yugoslav leadership to relent in a few weeks.  This scenario would allow the refugees to return to Kosovo before winter breaks.  Federal Chancellor Schroeder called for the airstrikes to continue in order to put increased pressure on Belgrade.  In a newspaper interview, Mr. Schroeder stated that political figures must remain consistent in their policy, even if public support begins to wane.  </field>

<field name="text">NATO has reportedly been much less successful in its air strikes against Yugoslavia than military leaders might have expected.  The newspaper Welt am Sonntag makes this report based on a secret file in its possession.  These sobering facts are forcing NATO to take stock of the situation, including the extent of the damage done to Yugoslav command posts.  The secret report also attributes the crash of an Apache combat helicopter to a hit from the Yugoslav air defenses at the beginning of May.  Previously, NATO has blamed the crash on technical failure.  In the afternoon, the Alliance presented its conclusions on the latest wave of air strikes.  Tanks, artillery, and grenade launchers in Kosovo were the preferred targets of NATO combat aircraft.  Attacks against the Serbian air force have increased throughout Yugoslavia.  According to Mr. Oberst, a NATO spokesperson, one third of the 245 airstrikes on Friday alone were used to take out ground-to-air missile installations and radar warning systems.  In addition, during the most intensive airstrikes since the beginning of the war, power plants and transformer stations have been hit.  For the second time in just a few days, the penitentiary in Istock also became one of the targets.  Yugoslavia has alleged that NATO killed several prisoners during the bombings.  NATO is prepared to acknowledge only two fatalities and claims that the building is no longer being used as a prison.  Formerly, the site was used as an interrogation point for Albanian detainees.  Since then, divisions of the Serbian army and the special police now work in the building.  NATO asserts that there was an airport in close proximity to the building which served as the launch site for operations in Kosovo.  </field>

Rau should be elected in the third round of voting at the latest, as only a simple majority of votes is required in this phase to elect.  </field>

<field name="text">Sudeten Germans got the support they had hoped for from the state government of Bavaria at the 50th Whitsun meeting in Nuremberg.  Minister President Stoiber opened the traditional Sudeten German Day event for which the organizers expected some 100,000 attendees.  In his speech, Stoiber took the federal government to task for clearly distancing itself from the Sudeten Germans' demands to the Czech Republic.  Federal Chancellor Schroeder has been quoted as telling the Czech Minister President Zemann that the deportation of the Sudeten Germans after World War II was a closed chapter of history.  He continued that the German federal government will not submit any demands for reparations.  The Bavarian Minister President interpreted this stance as a definite change in Germany's political policy in comparison to previous administrations.  Stoiber characterized the chancellor's words as a commentary indicating an ignorance of history and added that one could not simply make a clean break from the past.  The principles asserting the rights of the Kosovar Albanians should also be justly applied to the Sudeten Germans, he added.  </field>

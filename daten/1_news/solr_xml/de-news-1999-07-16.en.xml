<field name="text">The Federal Association of General Practioners refuted criticism of the planned health reforms voiced by privacy advocates. Talking of severe breaches of the Privacy Act was "way over the top", as president Hess said in an interview with the newspaper OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG. Collating and centralising patient data at public health insurers was not meant for spying on patients, but mainly for keeping doctors informed and under control. The Health Ministry added that patients would stay anonymous. No single patient's data would be available through a machine-readable diagnosis-code  </field>

<field name="text">Privacy concerns have been raised over the CDU's plans for mail-outs in campaigns against government's plans to reform pensions. Baden-Wuerttemberg State Privacy Commissioner Schneider said in Stuttgart that there was no law providing access to peoples' data stored at the local Registrar's. Some towns and villages were unsure if they were allowed to give out information to the CDU for this purpose. Minister for Internal Affairs Schaeuble, however, said that they were allowed to do that prior to elections. The Baden-Wuerttemberg local elections are scheduled for 14 October  </field>

<field name="text">The authorities in Bavaria and North-Rhine/Westphalia followed suit: after Baden-Wuerttemberg they also detected dioxin-contaminated animal feed. That was caused by clay from contaminated clay-pits in Rhineland-Palatinate. Clay serves as filler in the manufacture of animal feed. According to AP, at least 23 manufacturers in Germany had bought contaminated clay, as well as some in Switzerland and Austria. Bavarian and Swiss authorities, however, stated unanimously that there were no health concerns for consumers.  </field>

<field name="text">The SPD parliamentary group wants the law on 630-marks jobs amended, according to their manager Schmidt (sp?), and they want to push changes through, even if Finance Minister Eichel was against them, according to the newspaper BRAUNSCHWEIGER ZEITUNG. The tax-free allowance for work at sports-clubs would have to go up, and would have to get extended to cover all community-service activities. Head of the Association of Taxpayers Daeke also asked for amendments. According to a survey of almost 1000 small businesses, 25% of all workers had lost or given up their mini-jobs.  </field>

<field name="text">The shareholders of Hoechst AG cleared the way for a new pharmaceutical giant, viz. Aventis. 99.73% of them voted for an amalgamation with the French company Rhone-Poulenc. The debate preceding the vote lasted 19 hours, quite unexpectedly long. A small group of shareholders had tried to delay the vote by asking more and more questions. The new company will have a turnover of 34.5 billion marks, employ 92,000 staff and move their head office to Strasbourg/France.  </field>

<field name="text">Outgoing EU-Commissioner for Competition van Miert will take Germany to court for unlawful subsidies by German Post AG. The EU-Commission is to vote on the matter on Wednesday. Apparently he was reacting to a complaint by parcel service UPS, who had claimed that German Post AG, losing money on parcels yet making a profit on letters, cross-subsidised their parcel service. German Post AG said that they were quite relaxed about the matter. The Commission had had a go at them for the last five years. Cases dealing with anti-competitive behaviour as well as paying subsidies had all been thrown out by the courts.  </field></doc></add>

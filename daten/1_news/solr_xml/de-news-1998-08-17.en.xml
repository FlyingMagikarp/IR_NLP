<field name="text">Economic experts in the west fear the Russian financial crisis to also affect neighbouring countries. The weak rubel would put pressure on currencies of countries of the former Sovjet States. Some experts said that such a spiral of crises could jeopardize even the Chinese currency which is already suffering due to the Asia-crisis. Chief economist of the West German "Landesbank", Mr. Hombrecher, points to the fact that, after the Asia-crisis, another rising market declines. He said in the newspaper "Westdeutsche Allgemeinen Zeitung" that there are also dangers to the German export trade business.  </field>

<field name="text">In the course of the discussion about compensation payments for victims of the Holocaust, chairman of the German Jewish Committee, Ignaz Bubis, declared himself against economic pressure on German companies. Moreover, Bubis said in the Deutschlandfunk Radio, the situation in Germany would not be comparable to the situation in Switzerland. Immediatley after the war, Germany had implemented laws for compensation payments for the victims. Banks and industry, however, would still have reasons to agree on compensations. After the agreement between Swiss banks and Jewish organisations, he reckons with faster talks with German companies.  </field>

<field name="text">The SPD-representative for the economic building-up of the East, Schwanitz, declared himself in favour of changing the regulations for financial support. In the case of a victory of his party in the federal elections his party will  substantially simplify the distribution of money in the new States,  he said in the "Deutschlandradio Berlin".  He called the situation a "real financial support jungle in East Germany". Because of confusing regulations, mainly small and middle-sized businesses would stand no chances. Schwanitz supports the combination of different programs and the creation of more transparent conditions.  </field>

<field name="text">Apparently, the 11th day of death of Hitler's representative rudolf Hess was cause of numerous fights of right extremists. Two policemen were seriously injured by xenophobe youths in Fuerstenwalde/Brandenburg. The policemen were called because the youths previously had verbally attacked a Cuban couple. A car of a dark-skinned Frenchman and his femal friend was stopped by several men in Berlin. The right extremists kicked the couple and attacked them with teargas. Further incidents occurred in Berlitz near Potsdam where right extremists showed posters of Hess with the illegal Nazi-symbol.  </field>

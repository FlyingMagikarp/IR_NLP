<field name="text">The Social-Democrats reject reform plans by the government to reduce the maximum tax rate for personal incomes from 53 to 39 percent. SPD secretary-general Oskar Lafontaine commented that the maximum tax rate must remain at the current level because the constitution stipulates that people must be taxed according to their [financial] capabilities. Therefore, a trained worker cannot be put at the same level as an executive board member, a chancellor or a state premier.  </field>

<field name="text">Today, the federal Cabinet dealt with the new report on the situation of the German agriculture. One topic was the resurfaced BSE crisis that already affected the German beef market. According to a report by the daily Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung the number of farming enterprises in Germany has declined by 3% to about 540,000 farms. However, the winnings of the farmers have increased by 6.6%. The farming report, however, is for the period ending June 1996. This means that the financial losses due to cattle pest and swine plague have not been included. Therefore the government expects losses as the whole-year average.  </field>

<field name="text">The Christian-Democrats continue to back Federal Labour Minister Norbert Bluem in the pension debate. Last night, at an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Ahlen CDU platform, Bluem was given demonstrative applause. At the event in Ahlen, North-Rhine Westphalia, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the reform proposals by Bluem were a good base for further discussion. Kohl assured he would have the pension reform passed as quickly as possible because Germany must be fit for the next century. Incisive changes were therefore necessary. Meanwhile, the Liberal FDP has warned against a co-operation between Bluem and the SPD in matters of pension reform. Ms. Babel, the FDP's social expert, said in an interview, such a co-operation without the FDP would be a misfortune for the German people. Yardstick for the pension reform must be the stability of pension contributions. For the FDP the upper limit is 20 percent. Ms. Babel said: "For us, the Bluem proposal to increase contributions to 22.9 percent is not acceptable."  </field>

<field name="text">A goods train carrying German nuclear waste has derailed this morning on its way to the British reconditioning facility in Sellafield. According to police the accident near Apach, Lorraine, did not cause an increase of radioactivity. No-one was injured. The accident has presumably been caused by a shunting mistake.

<field name="text">A ministry spokesman in Saarbruecken stated that police did not want to exclude the possibility of an attack on the nuclear transport. Police are investigating whether the rails were broken. Another explanation is that the train was too heavy. The Saarland state government called for consequences. More than 120 nuclear waste transports cross roads and rails of Saarland annually. SPD Minister of Environment Leonard (sp?) repeated his demand to send nuclear waste by ship instead of by lorry or train. This, however, is rejected by people living near North Sea or Baltic Sea ports.  </field>

<field name="text">The threat of Germany's inner security by terrorist organizations has declined according to Prosecutor-General Nehm. At the annual press conference Mr. Nehm was optimistic. Terrorist group Red Army Faction and right-wing terrorism have become almost insignificant, and terrorists of the Kurdish PKK have come to political reason. Nehm criticized violent attacks on nuclear transports because the groups abused the freedom of assembly. Iran's threat of violence against judges and prosecutors in the Mykonos-trial was a threat to justice.  </field>

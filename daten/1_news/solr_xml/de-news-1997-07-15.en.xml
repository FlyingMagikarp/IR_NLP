<field name="text">The impact of environmentally dangerous substances on air, water, and soil in Germany has significantly diminished. Increasing traffic, however, remains an environmental problem. These are the conclusions of the latest Report on the Environment presented today by the Federal Office for the Environment. Environment Minister Angela Merkel said the basically positive development was due to legal regulations and narrow limits. At the same time, she pointed out new, complex environmental problems whose fight was much more difficult than that of individual chemicals. Merkel mentioned amongst others climate change, extinction of species, and increasing traffic.  </field>

<field name="text">Finance Minister Theo Waigel has asserted that subsidies for the eastern states will continue on a high level in the next budget year. He stated that the net transfer to the eastern states in 1998 would be DM90 billion. He pointed out that the promotion of investments had been spared almost all cuts. The minister refused to table a bill already now to reduce the solidarity tax by two percentage points in case the mediation talks about the tax reform failed. Waigel said he did not like such a plan, pointing at demands by coalition partner FDP. On Deutschlandfunk radio the FDP faction leader Hermann Otto Solms said if there is no other way, the solidarity tax would have to be reduced independent of the tax reform.  </field>

<field name="text">The quarrel about the reduction of the solidarity tax has put the coalition under a new grinding stress. Finance Minister Theo Waigel vehemently rejected the FDP's demand to reduce the tax even if the tax reform failed. Those who demand a separate tax must also be clear about the finance-political consequences, Waigel said after a meeting of the CSU executive board. A further increase of new debts was also out of the question. FDP faction leader Hermann Otto Solms had demanded earlier to reduce the solidarity tax even if the tax reform failed, that would be the only possibility. Economy and employees required this signal.  </field>

<field name="text">Employers and union have reached an agreement in the collective bargaining for the east German construction industry. The agreement provides that the gradual increase of wages to those in the west will be suspended. The wages will be kept at 94 percent of those in the west until March when new negotiations will start. At the same time, conditions for an employment guarantee have been agreed. They allow individual employers to reduce union wages by up to 10 percent to avoid impending lay-offs, short time or work by a subcontractor.  </field>

<field name="text">Saxony-Anhalt's Environment Minister Heidrun Heidecke has announced that she would use the full extent of the law to fight the revision of the nuclear energy code planned by Federal Environment Minister Angela Merkel. In view of the planned extension of the permit for the nuclear storage facility Morsleben until 2005 the Alliance90/Greens politician said on Deutschlandfunk radio that this was environmental protection of low quality. The CDU/CSU Bundestag faction spokesman for energy issues Kurt-Dieter Grill called on the SPD to pass a motion regarding the revision of the nuclear code. The Social-Democrats could not say on the one side that they would support nuclear power for the next 25 to 30 years and on the other side refuse to accept a disposal plan.  </field>

<field name="text">Bank customers will no longer have to pay fees for ordering their banks to exempt their accounts from automatic taxation of interests. The Federal High Court in Karlsruhe ruled this morning that contrary conditions by the banks were void. They argued that investors would be disadvantaged by this administrative fee in an incommensurate way. Until now, some banks have charged annual fees of between DM10 and DM15.  </field>

<field name="text">CDU politician Wissmann welcomed econcmy minister Mueller's proposal for restructuring economic policies. Speaking to radio "Deutschlandfunk", Wissmann qualified his opinion by saying that it was not sufficient to formulate well-phrased proposals unless they were followed by corresponding actions. To be consistent, the government would also have to take back their reform in the health area and rethink their fiscal policies. Lowering the government's gross tax bite, and non-homogeneous wage policies were singled out by the CDU politician as steps in the right direction.  Unions, on the other hand, rejected the minister's proposals offhand, callimg them bad economic policy and socially unbalanced, in the opinion of the white collar workers'union DAG.

Re-socializing the perpetrators must not be the law's foremost concern, said the CDU politician in Wiesbaden. He wants to see convict time done in prison as a rule. The law in question was by now 22 years old and tainted by a number of "socially romanticized assumptions" (sic), the minister said. An equilibrium between "re-socialization" and "protection of citizens" as main aims of penal execution must be reestablished.  </field>

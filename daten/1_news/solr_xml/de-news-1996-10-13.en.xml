<field name="text">The Green Party wants to become more involved in economic policy and set its own accents. Chairman of the Executive Board Trittin demanded today during a strategy congress to concentrate on the three priorities of ecological renewal of the economy, fair distribution of work and income, and basic social security. In the parliamentary election of 1998, a shift in economic policy will be at stake. Either Germany will become radically free-market, or it will show solidarity. Party speaker Sager encouraged the delegates to engage in a debate about the future. The Green Party has to show that it is prepared for tough subjects and tough times. Yesterday, State Premier of Saxony-Anhalt Hoeppner (SPD) argued for a red-green alliance on the federal level. Hoeppner is the first social democratic State Premier participating in such an event sponsored by the Green Party.  </field>

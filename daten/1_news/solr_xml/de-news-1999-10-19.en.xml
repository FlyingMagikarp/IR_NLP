<field name="text">German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder rejected demands to abolish the shopping hours limit on weekdays. The demand had been put forward by the Federal Association of German Retailers (HDE) at its delegate conference. The chancellor said that this demand would not be realized. The legislature and those concerned should take their time to find a reasonable regulation and not be hasty. HDE president Hermann Frantzen demanded that conditions across the country had to be made similar again. He hoped that a new law could be passed by the end of next year. He also demanded that shopping be allowed on four Sundays per year without a particular occasion. The HDE delegates dismissed keeping the 8pm-closing time and adopted a motion for unlimited shopping hours.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government's emergency scheme to fight youth unemployment was only partially successful, said Dieter Hundt, president of the employers' association. Youths who did not finish school or have been unemployed for more than six months were rarely helped by the scheme. Those groups, however, were the most problematic ones. The president of the Federal Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda had said earlier that the emergency scheme was showing signs of success. There were fewer open positions and more placed youths.  </field>

<field name="text">About 50.000 people participated in the rallies of the German Federation of Unions (DGB) and the German Alliance of Civil Servants. So far, this was the largest demonstration against the savings plan of the federal government. The rallies' slogan was "Free negotiation of pay, not dictation". The government had announced that for the next two years the pay of civil servants would rise only in line with inflation. The president of the Civil Servants Alliance, Erhard Geyer, said it was utterly anti-social to decouple civil servants of German Post, fire brigades, and other important services from the general increase of income. The second demand was to raise wages in the eastern states to those in the western states. It is impossible to treat employees in the east as second-class workers ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  </field>

<field name="text">The FDP party will not have to pay back the contentious 10.5 million marks they received from government, for the time being. They will, however, get 'backpay' to the tune of 5.7 million marks, a sum that had been frozen so far while the courts were still looking at the matter. This followed a decision by the Muenster Administrative Court, which effectively quashed the former ruling by a Cologne court. The latter had decided last November that government would have to ask for the monies to be refunded immediately.  </field>

<field name="text">The intermediate storage facility for nuclear waste at Lubmin in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania caused a bit of a tiff between coalition partners. Minister for Internal Affairs Jaeger, of the CDU, had agreed to setting up the storage facility for nuclear waste from the nuclear power plants at Greifswald and Rheinsberg, among others. The SPD, however, thought that he had breached the coalition agreement by doing so.  </field>

<field name="text">The biggest deployment of police ever will take place when nuclear waste in a so-called CASTOR-container will be sent to the intermediate storage facility at Aarhaus. A total of 6 containers will be on their way at the end of March. A year ago, 30,000 police were deployed for the transport of a container to another storage facility (at Gorleben), but this pale in comparison to this year's numbers.  </field>

<field name="text">Police had had some success in the investigation of schoolgirl Karla's murder, as they probably managed to retrace where her murderer went when he fled. Two witnesses claimed they saw him race his car from Wilhermsdorf to the next village. Police issued bills asking the general public for hints and tip-offs.  12-year old Karla from Wilhermsdorf near Fuerth was on her way to school on 22 January, when she was raped by a person unknown so far, and dumped in a pond. She died 5 days later.  </field>

<field name="text">Russian President Boris Yeltsin began a 3-day visit to Germany today, arriving in Baden-Baden in the evening. He is to meet with Chancellor Kohl there tomorrow. Tomorrow evening, Yeltsin is to be given the German Media Award. The president is expected to bring up the controversial Russian Captured Art Law (German: Beutekunstgesetz) during his talks with Kohl. The Russian Federation Council postponed the final vote on the law, which had been expected today. According to this law, cultural goods which were seized in Germany during the Second World War and taken to the former Soviet Union will be declared Russian property. According to a spokesman, Yeltsin wants to return some of the art collection during his visit.  </field>

<field name="text">The Iranian government has accused the Higher Court in Berlin of arriving at its ruling in the Mykonos trial in an unfair, biased, and illegal manner. A letter which Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati (sp?) sent to the foreign embassies in Teheran also said that the judgement was more a political declaration than a judicial document. The public prosecutor's office in Germany meanwhile continues to look at instigating legal proceedings against the Iranian leadership. A spokesman for the office announced that the spoken legal opinion of the judges in Berlin is presently being evaluated as a basis for such action.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Foreign Minister Kinkel has confirmed, speaking with UN Secretary-General Anan, that Germany is aspiring to a permanent seat on the Security Council of the United Nations. At a joint press conference, Kinkel said that the question of whether the seat would include a veto was not of primary importance. The secretary-general, on his maiden visit to Germany, said that the Security Council reflects the realities of 1945, and must be changed to fit those of today. He added, however, that how and when that will happen is not yet clear, although he thought that the suggestion of veto-less seats would not find majority support at the UN. The president of the General Assembly had urged that Germany and Japan should be given permanent seats on the Security Council but without the right to veto.  </field>

<field name="text">European Union Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies has called for the decision over participants in European monetary union to take into account the high costs of reunification in Germany. In a newspaper interview, Wulf-Mathies said that Germany must be allowed to enter into the monetary union even if it fails to meet the entrance criteria this year. She also said that the Maastricht Treaty did permit this, and that an exception was necessary for Germany because without reunification the numbers would have been different. Finance Minister Waigel, on the other hand, speaking in the Bundestag's finance committee, reaffirmed that the criteria for the introduction of the Euro must be strictly applied. He expressed confidence that Germany could meet the criteria in time.  </field>

<field name="text">The Green Party has presented its own model for tax reform. Central points of the model are a serious simplification of the tax system and a lowering of rates in income tax. The finance spokesman for the party's parliamentary group, Scheel, said in Bonn that this model was more consistent than the Government's. The Greens want incomes below DM 15,000 to be tax-free, higher incomes to be taxed at rates between 18.5 percent and (for incomes over DM 120,000) 45 percent. In all, the model foresees redistributing 100 billion Marks in taxes, especially in favour of families with children. A net tax break is not planned, given the country's economic situation, Scheel emphasized.  </field>

<field name="text">Germany has much work to do in ensuring the secrecy of information. Federal information expert Jacob, in his report for 1995/96, called on the state to change its protocols to suit technological developments. In the private sphere, information must be made more secure, he said; the present concept of privacy of information, concentrating as it does on the state, is no longer in tune with the times. Given computer networking, citizens should be better protected from the mis-use of information on them by private companies. The report also says that it is unclear when video surveillance should be permitted; the use of chip cards also needs to be regulated - although, in any case, personal data on such cards should be restricted to the minimum required.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Government has announced a career training reform project. The goal is to get companies to create more apprentice positions by changing the training regulations. Federal Education Minister Ruettgers called on unions and companies to correspondingly adopt concrete agreements in their wage contracts. The minister also wants the states to get rid of the second day of formal classroom instruction for apprentices each week, and to make instruction times more flexible. He insists that career training must be modernized by having less theory and more operational practice. Furthermore, according to Ruettgers, foreign companies should also be encouraged to offer more apprentice positions. He wants the number of such positions to increase by 2 percent in each of the coming years. The reform project also provides for the introduction of an intermediate journeyman's ticket: apprentices who fail the theoretical part of their exam will receive a certificate for the parts they passed. Ruettgers explained that it was absurd to put young people with a talent for any given trade on the sidelines just because they had difficulty with formulistic knowledge.  </field>

<field name="text">Bad Neuenahr. The IG Metall union says it will go on strike if that is what it takes to reach a settlement over part-time work for older employees. Union leaders emphasized this position at a closed meeting in Bad Neuenahr. The union also reaffirmed its demand for a shorter work-week of 32 hours, beginning in 1999, saying that that was the most promising path in the fight against unemployment. The leader of the employer's association Gesamtmetall, Stumpfe, again rejected shorting work times. He described the threat of a strike as irresponsible.  </field>

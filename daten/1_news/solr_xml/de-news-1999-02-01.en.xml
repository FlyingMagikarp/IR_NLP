<field name="text">At the end of December, 37,000 persons in Germany were HIV positive. According to figures from the Robert Koch Institute, this number has never been this high since the discovery of the virus. Every year, approximately 2000 persons are infected with the virus in Germany. In the same time period, the number of persons contracting AIDS went down. The researchers reported that 800 persons contracted AIDS last year, while 800 persons died from AIDS. These numbers are the lowest over the last ten years. The higher number of infections, yet lower number of contractions appears to be the result of new treatment methods. Since therapies exist which use a combination of treatment substances, doctors are able to further delay the outbreak of the disease.  </field>

<field name="text">The main railway station in Cologne was closed to all railway traffic in the afternoon following a bomb threat. The bomb was not found, but the main railway station has been opened again. An anonymous caller had informed a fire station that a bomb would explode in the main railway station within two minutes. Although nothing happened, the main railway station in Cologne was closed and search dogs were brought in. Since they could not uncover anything, the "all-clear" signal was sounded at 5 p.m. In the meantime, thousands of travellers had to wait outside. Since Cologne is one of the major railway traffic junctions in Europe, travellers to and from Cologne will have to anticipate major delays until 10 p.m., officials from the Bahn AG announced.  </field>

<field name="text">According to a recommendation of the EU-Commission, the European Monetary Union can start with eleven countries at the beginning of next year. According to the commission in Brussels, this will include Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Finland. The European Currency Institute expressed itself with greater reservation. Its president, Deusenberg, explained at the presentation of his report on convergence that in most countries corrections are still necessary. The Euro-readiness of Italy and Belgium in particular are doubted. The Institute also requires further consolidation steps on the part of Germany. Of the 15 European Union states, only Greece did not meet qualifications for monetary union. Britain, Denmark and Sweden do not want to introduce the Euro until later. In Bonn, the government and SPD opposition welcomed both the recommendations. Bavarian State Premier Stoiber said however, in respect to the different evaluations in each of the reports, there are still open questions. Now it is crucial how the concerns of the Currency Institute will be taken into account. In May, the heads of state and government of the EU want to make a final decision on the future membership of the economic and monetary union.  </field>

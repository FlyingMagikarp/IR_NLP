<field name="text">Rudolf Scharping, the SPD parliamentary leader, has said that he considers it irresponsible to further postpone tax reform negotiations in the light of the record high of 4.5 million unemployed. He said to the "Deutschlandfunk" radio station that the necessary economic conditions must be fundamentally improved immediately. He continued that the SPD are still prepared to lower taxes immediately, to make concessions for employers and families and to limit certain tax deductions. At this point, Mr. Scharping announced the SPD's draft law in this regard, which was proposed by Hans Eichel, the State Premier of Hesse. The draft will be refined over the next few days and then possibly submitted for consideration to the Bundesrat [upper house of parliament]. Mr Scharping stressed that the coalition government's resolution not to negotiate on tax reforms with the SPD for the time being was proof that the present government was incapable of action.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr. Geier, the Chairman of the German Federation of Civil Servants, has spoken out in defence of continuing teachers' civil servant status.  Mr. Geier said in a newspaper interview that teachers who are in civil service should not cost the State more than those who do not have this status, and that they were considerably more flexible. For instance, they could be transferred to areas where they are needed more quickly. Mr Geier referred to several comparative studies in this regard. Mr. Mai, the head of the Union for Public Service and Transportation (OETV), had called for the civil servant status to be abolished and had said that, except for a few exceptions such as the Fire Brigade, the Police, the Judiciary and the state Tax and Revenue Offices, civil servants were not necessary. He continued that the German civil servant system could only be understood by looking at its history.  </field>

<field name="text">Brandenburg is getting ready for the worst flooding in 70 years. The water level of the Oder River is expected to crest by the weekend. According to the boss at the environment bureau of the state of Brandenburg, Matthias Freude, it will be much worse than expected. Experts at the bureau now anticipate that the river will rise to over 6 metres. Dikes along the Oder will then be near inundation, with no more than 1 metre of leeway. The polders in the state have already been flooded. 3000 hectares of the Lower Oder Valley National Park are already under water, and another 2000 hectares may yet come to be. The height of the incoming flood water can only be estimated at the present time. Reliable reports are no longer available out of Poland, where the water level gauges have been swept away by the flood. The city of Frankfurt (an der Oder - not Frankfurt am Main) is particularly threatened by the flooding. Evacuation plans for Frankfurt and the surrounding area have been worked out, and there are a million sandbags standing by.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal cabinet has decided on controversial changes to the law governing nuclear power plants in Germany. In the future, plants will, for the first time, be able to be built without the approval of the state affected. The new bill provides for a permit procedure entirely under federal control, regardless of the location. The expropriation of land to build a plant upon will also be made easier. This latter clause arises after the case of a property owner in Gorleben, in Lower Saxony, who has so far successfully refused to give up his land, making use of the Mining Law against exploration of the alpenstock. The state of Saxony -Anhalt plans to challenge the changes, which also allow for the operation of the Morsleben nuclear waste dump for 5 years longer than originally expected. The SPD, the Greens, and the PDS reject the planned changes, and feel that the bill should also have to pass through the Bundesrat. Federal Environment Minister Merkel does not see any need for a vote by the state representatives in that body.  </field>

<field name="text">Premier of Lower Saxony, Schroeder, is in favour of a red-green coalition, if the federal election in the fall of 1998 results in a combined majority of SPD and Greens. Talking to 'Stern' magazine, Schroeder also called for a timely declaration on the part of the federal SPD of a red-green coalition in Bonn to their goal in the election. He said it was a question of credibility: "The citizens of Germany won't buy it if we waffle and say we'll decide after the election".  </field>

<field name="text">In its second, final reading, Baden-Wuerttemberg's Landtag has passed the inter-state broadcasting treaty of the future radio station South-West Radio (Suedwestrundfunk - SWR). The representatives of the CDU, the FDP, as well as most of the representatives of the Opposition SPD, voted in favour of the fusion of the present SDR and SWF stations. Alliance90/the Greens and the Republikaners rejected the fusion. Prior to the vote, petitions from the SPD and the Greens, to assure that the individual transmitters and studios in the coming SWR would have their own personnel representation, were rejected.

<field name="text">2 years after the hostage-taking in a Berlin bank, the last suspect has been arrested in Lebanon. The robbers escaped at that time, with the loot, through a tunnel they had dug. 7 of them have already been tried and sentenced. Wisam Risk (sp?) is believed to be one of the men who spent months digging a tunnel to the Commerzbank in the Zehlendorf area of Berlin. He is not thought to have been in the bank himself and did not take part in the robbery and hostage-taking. Nevertheless, Risk is considered one of the leading figures in the robbery. According to Detlef Buettner, who was the chairman of the now-defunct 'Koba' special commission investigating the case, "We now have everyone who was directly involved in building the tunnel and in the robbery itself". For Buettner and his men, the case is now solved, but not closed. Over DM 4 million of the loot is still missing, and one man is still free, although he is thought to have been only a helper to the tunnel gang.  </field>

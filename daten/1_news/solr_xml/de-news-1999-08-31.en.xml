<field name="text">Finance Minister Hans Eichel can expect the support of the federal and state SPD for his austerity package. Budget experts and finance ministers of states with SPD governments discussed the package for two days in Wismar. Afterwards, the head of the working group, Wagner, said the participants had no fundamental criticism of the austerity package. The state premiers of Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Reinhard Hoeppner and Harald Ringstorff, announced that their states would vote for the package in the Bundesrat. The consolidation of finances was necessary for the federal government to be able to support the eastern states even after the expiration of the solidarity pact in 2004. About 30 SPD left wingers, however, demanded changes to the austerity package, especially a taxation of large private assets.  </field>

<field name="text">The members of the B90/G faction of the Bundestag have met in Weimar for a two-day closed-door meeting. The faction wants to review its performance since the change of government. Main topics will be the pension and environmental policies and the pull out from nuclear energy. Federal Environment Minister Juergen Trittin and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also participate in the meeting. In a working paper pension expert Goering-Eckart (sp?) demands that pensio       ?d be increased in line with inflation even after 2001 and not in relation with the average net income [as it is now, but according to Eichel's plans, pensions will be tied to inflation rate until 2001]. The target is to reduce the pension level to 65% of the income. Private old-age insurance must be encouraged and supported by tax benefits. Faction leader Kerstin Mueller said that limiting the increase of pensions to the rate of inflation for the next two years was not sufficient. Before the meeting, faction leaders Kerstin Mueller and Rezzo Schlauch had called on the faction members to adopt the coalition's tax and austerity package without reductions of the content. On Monday, the spokesperson for the executive board of B90/G, Ms. Radke, had criticized coalition partner SPD because of its internal quarrels about the austerity package. She was afraid that the current performance of the SPD could hurt the Greens. Many in the East were angry about the package.  </field>

<field name="text">The designated budget comissioner Schreyer wants to intensify the fight against fraud and mismanagement in the European Commission. The former Greens senator for the environment said at the beginning of her hearing for the Europarliamentary Committee, that it was the only way to win back people's faith. The 48-year old promised to be sparing with EU money and described the expansion of the EU as one of the most important tasks for the coming five years. At the same time, Schreyer rejected criticism from conservative delegates who claimed that she has too little experience with working on an international level and with budgetary policy. The week long hearing of the new comissioner for the Competency Committee of the Europarliament began on Monday.  On Wednesday it will be SPD politician Verheugen's turn. He is earmarked as commissioner for eastern expansion.  </field>

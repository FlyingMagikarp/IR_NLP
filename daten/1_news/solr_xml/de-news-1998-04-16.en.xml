<field name="text">The murder sentence against Pastor Klaus Geyer was continued in the morning at the Regional Court in Braunschweig. Geyer is accused of slaying his wife in the heat of passion. The 20th day of trial began with two dead ants. One ant was found on the dead body of Veronika Geyer and the other one was found under a dirty boot the police seized in Geyer's vehicle. Several experts agreed that the dirt came with great likelihood from the scene of the crime. A comparison of the two ants is supposed to reveal whether the two animals are alike and could be from the crime scene. Delays in the trial are expected if the experts cannot come to a clear result.  </field>

<field name="text">Henkel fears the elimination of jobs due to the energy tax. The President of the Federation of the German Industry rejects the introduction of so-called energy taxes to make energy more expensive. It would lead to higher unemployment and prevent investment. A reduction of carbon dioxide emissions could not be guaranteed with such a tax. The Bavarian State Premier Stoiber called the discussions about the energy tax unrealistic and rejected increased costs of energy on a national level.  </field>

<field name="text">With ceremonies in Berlin, German politicians honoured the American General Lucius Clay. Clay died 20 years ago and is known as the organizer of the airlift. The Mayor of Berlin Diepgen said at ceremonies at the Tempelhof airport that Clay saved the people from death from starvation and secured freedom and democracy in Berlin. In 1948, Berlin was blocked off by the Soviets under Stalin, and the only supply lines were the three air corridors of the Allied forces. In the first untertaking of its kind, groceries and supplies were flown in from the Western regions. Supplies were dropped off on nearly 300,000 flights from planes referred to as "Rosinenbomber" (Raisin Bombers).  </field>

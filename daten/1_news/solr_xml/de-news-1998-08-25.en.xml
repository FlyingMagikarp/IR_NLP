<field name="text">Family Minister Claudia Nolte has  presented today the Report on Children and Youth that had been withheld so far.  According to expert opinion the situation of families with children has  deteriorated radically in Germany. Increasingly more children had to live of  social assistance. In East Germany, 22 percent and in West Germany 12 percent of  all children are classified as poor. One of the highest risks for poverty is  separation of the parents according to the report. The federal government  rejected the report. Mrs. Nolte particularly rejected the definition of poverty  as having available less than half the average income. Further, the equation of  poverty with payments of social assistance was unsuitable. Nolte said that an  economist should have been member of the Children and Youth Committee. Instead,  Family Minister Nolte emphasized that even according to numbers presented by the  experts, the proportion of poor children had decreased significantly since the  1980s. So far, the federal government had tripled the assistance for families  and will improve them even in the coming legislature period. The president of  the parliamentary Family Committee, Edith Niehues, SPD, reproached Mrs. Nolte of  minimizing child poverty and of hiding behind definition issues. Similar  comments had Christa Nickels, GREEN member of parliament. The Kinderschutzbund  (Children Protection Alliance) pointed out that the method to measure child  poverty was uniform in all EU countries.  </field>

<field name="text">In case of a government take-over the  SPD candidate for chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder is going to include party  president Oskar Lafontaine in the cabinet. In an interview with the daily  Rheinische Post Schroeder stressed, however, that Lafontaine would not head a  super-ministry for finances and economics. Lafontaine in turn confirmed his  intention to take a federal office in case of an SPD election victory. On SAT1  television Lafontaine said that he would run for faction leadership if the  party's majority was slim. But if the majority was stable he might also assume a  government office, especially the finance ministry.  </field>

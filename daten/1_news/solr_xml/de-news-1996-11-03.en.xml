<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl is back after traveling through Asia for one and a half weeks. His airplane landed last night at the airport Ramstein. The Chancellor had been scheduled to land at the airport Koeln-Bonn, but 1000 miners were rallying there against the mining policy of the German government. They wanted to remind Kohl of his promises in regards to mining, particularly subventions for hard coal mining. CDU Vice Chairman and State Premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg Teufel had proposed to dramatically cut mining subsidies. Expenses of almost 10 billion marks per year can not be justified given the budget problems.  </field>

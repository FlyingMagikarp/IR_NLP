<field name="text">Wolfgang Schaueble, the parliamentary leader of the CDU/CSU, is according to Bavaria's state premier Edmund Stoiber qualified to take on any political office. He said in an interview that the comments made by Mr. Schaueble's wife should not be used as a political instrument. He also criticised the current internal debate in the CDU/CSU regarding the post of Chancellor. He continued that he did not think it was a good idea to talk about a successor to Chancellor Kohl, when Kohl was still party leader for the coming elections. Mrs Ingeborg Schauble had said in an interview that she thought, due to health considerations, her husband should not be Kohl's successor as Chancellor. This triggered renewed debate within party ranks.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Retail Trade Association (HDI) estimates that new jobs could be created through the government subsidised wage ("Kombilohn"). Mr. Wenzel, Managing Director of the HDI, said that the wage scheme could be applied to around 100 000 firms and that "if only half of these companies take on one unemployed person, that would still mean 50 000 jobs". At the same time, however, Mr. Wenzel cautioned that "Kombilohn" jobs could well threaten normal jobs. The CDU/CSU have proposed that the wages of long-term unemployed be subsidised if they accepted low-wage jobs. This could be up to 77 percent of their last net wage.  </field>

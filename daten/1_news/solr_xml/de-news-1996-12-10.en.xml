<field name="text">Employers in the metal sector of the district of North Wuerttemberg/North Baden reject 100% sick pay. They criticised the bargaining agreement in Lower Saxony. The cost level would be too high for the companies because the agreement disregards that remuneration should of course take into account the work hours missed due to illness. Therefore, employers of the district of North Wuerttemberg/North Baden want to continue negotiations with the IG Metall union soon.  Meanwhile in the district of South Baden-Wuerttemberg, negotiations seem to be more successful. The commissions of both sides, though, still have to agree on details of the bargaining agreement including full sick pay.  </field>

<field name="text">Collective bargaining negotiations between the DAG union and Lufthansa have been suspended without results last night. Consequently, flying personnel and ground personnel will stage a limited walkout on Thursday.  According to the DAG union, Lufthansa's executive board still rejects to offer pay rises in the usual scale for next year. The management wants to reach a similar agreement as the one already accepted by the OeTV union. According to this agreement, employees get a one-time payment of 33% of the monthly salary before March 1997, and a pay rise of 1.7% in 1998.  Lufthansa offers all their customers who have booked a long-distance flight on Thursday to change their bookings of inner-German flights to Wednesday without extra fees.  </field>

<field name="text">The national trade union federation (DGB) expects the number of unemployed in Germany to reach at least four million this month. DGB's deputy head Ursula Engelen-Kefer said in a newspaper interview a new high since WW II could be reached by the end of the month. Ms Engelen-Kefer blames government failures for the problem - the coalition government again and again cuts funds of the Federal Labour Office and thus increases unemployment.  </field>

<field name="text">The coalition government needs more time to decide on all details of the planned income tax reform. Despite earlier plans to announce them before Christmas, discussions will now be finished by the end of January, said head of CSU members of parliament Michael Glos. The FDP is optimistic that experts will at least agree on the corner stones of the tax reform by Christmas, in particular the minimum and the maximum income tax rate. The main problem is the compensation for this tax cut of some Dm80bn. Therefore the coalition government plans to cut tax privileges rigorously. FDP head Wolfgang Gerhardt rejects increases of other taxes.  FDP and CDU/CSU quarrel again over when to decide on the decrease of the solidarity surcharge tax. The Liberal Democrats insist on taking this decision by the end of this month, while CDU/CSU do not want to decide on the matter before having figured out all the details of the tax reform.  </field>

<field name="text">The foreign minister of NATO's member states approved today the conception for a new employment of peace troops in Bosnia. Germany will send more than 3,000 of a total of 30,000 troops that will oversee the implementation of the Dayton peace accord. The UN security council still has to approve the mission, though. The UN mandate for the NATO commanded IFOR mission ends December 20.  </field>

<field name="text">The SPD faction in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) approves the deployment of German troops for NATO's peace mission in Bosnia but it will nonetheless boycott the parliamentary voting on the matter. The faction decided unanimously that it was necessary to wait with the voting until the UN security council approves the mission. This, however, will not happen before Friday morning. Therefore, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel asked the Bundestag to take a preliminary decision to avoid a special session next week.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federation of Sudete-Germans has heavily criticised the German-Czech declaration that was published yesterday. On the other hand, FDP and Greens signaled approval. The Head of the Federation of Sudete-Germans, Mr Neubauer, called the text unacceptable since the expulsion of Sudete-Germans after WW II by the Czech Republic is not pronounced wrong. According to Mr Neubauer, the declaration does not even consider any measures for reparation. In particular, the Sudete-Germans demand the right to live in the Czech Republic.  Head of CSU members of parliament Michael Glos does not want to exclude the possibility of rejecting the treaty. The CSU is the party that backs the Sudete-Germans most strongly. Mr Glos wants that as many as possible of the demands of the Sudete-Germans will be met.  On the other hand, FDP head Wolfgang Gerhardt and politician of the Greens Antje Vollmer praise the declaration as a great achievement for appeasement.  Czech Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Wondra (sp?), called the declaration an important contribution to the future cooperation of both states.  Bavaria's State Premier Edmund Stoiber does not consider the German-Czech talks to be finished. He assumes that before paraphing the contract on December 20 in Prague it will again be discussed within the coalition in Bonn.  Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel regretted that the text of the declaration had been published early. At the meeting of NATO's foreign ministers in Brussels he said he will not comment on the declaration before it has been signed.  </field>

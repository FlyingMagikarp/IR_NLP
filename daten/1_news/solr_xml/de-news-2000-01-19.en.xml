<field name="text">One of the deputy leaders of the CDU, Christian Wulff, is saying that the final report by the team of auditors investigating the donations affair can be expected to reveal the existence of a further 9 million D-Marks of unclear origin. The funds arrived in CDU accounts prior to 1993. The party's Secretary-General, Angela Merkel, told ARD television that there was some, in any case, additional unaccounted-for income. She also said that former Chancellor Helmut Kohl was the only one who could clear up the matter. Kohl, meanwhile, speaking to the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, reaffirmed his intention to keep the promise he made to those who gave him around 2 million D-Marks in cash donations between 1993 and 1998, not to reveal their identities.  </field>

<field name="text">According to Premier Roland Koch of Hesse, there have been more fund transfers from a secret Swiss bank account to the state's CDU party apparatus than previously revealed. Koch told the "Frankfurter Rundschau" newspaper that account movements in the party's books had caught his attention, apparently cash donations being entered as "other income". Koch said the party books were kept in the office of former CDU tax advisor Horst Weyrauch. According to newspaper reports, Weyrauch was also responsible for the auditing of the books. Koch said the situation "needed clarification".  </field>

<field name="text">The parliamentary investigation committee looking into the North Rhine-Westphalia "flight affair" has heard Sabine Wichmann as its first witness, the widow of the PJC airline chief pilot. Wichmann contradicted accounts from Federal President Johannes Rau and North Rhine-Westphalia Finance Minister Heinz Schleusser. She spoke of several private flights by the politicians. The Westdeutsche Landesbank (West/LB) chartered and - at least in part - paid for PJC jets, on which the politicians flew. Rau's lawyers had issued a statement saying that Rau did not take any flights paid for by West/LB during his tenure as Premier of North Rhine-Westphalia.  </field>

<field name="text">The North Rhine-Westphalian branch of the IG Metall union is demanding 5.5% more pay for its 750,000 members in the current contract negotiations. The largest of the regional union branches has thus accepted the recommendation of the union's federal executive. It is also calling for allowances for early retirement for aged workers. The chief negotiator for the branch, Harald Schartau, said in Bochum that the demand for an "employment bridge" had nothing to do with the "retirement at 60" negotiated within the framework of the federal Alliance for Work. The metals union branch in the region of Bavaria was the first to adopt the demand for 5.5% in 2000.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and ministers within the SPD-Green coalition have completed the discussion on their position in further negotiations regarding the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Government spokesman Uwe-Carsten Heye reaffirmed the government's desire for an amicable agreement with the plant owners. The primary concern at the talks was to determine how soon a legally-enforced shutdown could come into effect, in the event that a step-by-step withdrawal cannot be negotiated with the industry. The Greens demand a maximum lifespan of 30 years for the plants. The next meeting with the chief executives of the 4 leading energy companies is scheduled for February 4.  </field>

<field name="text">Just three weeks after its implementation, the four-stage eco-tax has again become a bone of contention between Government and Opposition in the Bundestag. The CDU/CSU and FDP spoke of "picking the pockets of the driving public". They called the plan unconstitutional, socially unfair, and ecologically ineffective. The Premier of the Saarland, Peter Mueller, and CSU representative Hans Michelbach called upon the Government to withdraw the reform. The Deputy Finance Minister, Karl Diller (SPD), rejected the suggestion. He said that the Government did not expect a legal suit by the transportation industry, or similar challenges, to have any chance of success in reversing the tax.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">Apparently the reforms of the health sector are slowly beginning to take shape. SPD and the Greens agreed on the first common ground at a meeting behind closed doors. There are plans now to provide better treatment for patients by close co-operation between stationary and non-stationary care. The coalition parties also want to strengthen the position of the family doctor, and they furthermore agreed on a positive list for drugs public health insurers would pay for (probably axing what's *not* on the list). The new rules will apply as of next year.  </field>

<field name="text">In Lower Saxony both sides agreed on accepting the Baden-Wuerttemberg compromise for metal-workers, after recent arbitration there. It provides for 3.2% more pay as of March, plus a one-off payment of 1% of a yearly wage. For the months of January and February there will be lump-sum payments of 350 marks each. Early last night, however, members of the Employers' Federation, to everyone's surprise, declared:" We can't wear that, it's too expensive for us." A final solution must be reached until 2 March.  </field>

<field name="text">Approximately 21 years after the RAF kidnapped and killed Mr Martin Schleyer, erstwhile president of the Employers' Federation, one of the four perpetrators, Mr Stephan Wischniewski, will be released from prison. In 1981 he had received two life sentences. Now the Higher Regional Court in Dusseldorf ruled that he had cut all ties with terrorism and wanted to stay away from it for good.

<field name="text">After abundant snowfalls in the Alps there is renewed danger of avalanches, reaching 4 points (on a scale of five) in the Bavarian Alps. Bavaria's Environment Minister Schnappauf warned skiers: "Avalanches are life-threatening". In Switzerland and Austria access-roads to many ski-resorts are blocked by snow. Authorities think they will take at least till Sunday to clear the access-roads to Adelboden and Grindelwald (Switzerland). Currently about 20,000 tourists are marooned in the two villages, so air-transport has been arranged to fly them out this weekend.   </field></doc></add>

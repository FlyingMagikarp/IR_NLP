<field name="text">The SPD representative to the Bundestag and chair of the parliamentary control commission, Penner, has called for the termination of German relations with Iran. Penner told the radio station "Hessischer Rundfunk" that the politics of so-called critical dialogue between Bonn and Teheran had suffered a severe throw-back. Penner elaborated that if it was to turn out that the Iranian government was behind the attack on the Berlin restaurant Mykonos, then diplomatic relations with such a government could not be continued. During the Berlin Mykonos trial, the former Iranian leader, Banisadre, had severely incriminated the Iranian prime minister Rafsandjani (sp?) and the Iranian religious leader Chamenei (sp?), yesterday. The murder of four opposition politicians is said to have occurred with their full knowledge and consent.  </field>

<field name="text">The state premier of Rhineland Palatinate, Beck, has introduced a draft for a compromise in the deliberations concerning the savings packing of the federal government. Beck said in an interview with the newspaper "Leipziger Volkszeitung" that  both savings and tax measures needed to be addressed on Monday. He believes that an agreement between cabinet and SPD is possible. If no such agreement was reached, there was danger of wasting time over minor points and of state and federal governments playing each other off against one another, said Beck.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Minister of Finance Rexrodt expressed his hope for a compromise in the disagreement between Saxony and the European Commission regarding the subsidies paid without EU approval by Saxony to the car manufacturer "Volkswagen." In an interview with the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the FDP politician said that if VW did not spend the money but rather put it away for now, this could be grounds for negotiations. The deciding factor was whether the company was going to play along with such a measure, said Rexrodt. He further accused the Saxon state premier Biedenkopf of imposing massive strain on the relationship with the EU Commission. Biedenkopf, on the other hand, said that any yielding by the Saxon state government was out of the question. He explained that 23,000 jobs depended on the subsidies for the VW plants in the towns of Chemnitz and Mosel. In an interview with the magazine "Super-Ilu," the State Premier concluded that the future of the entire region depended on these funds.  </field>

<field name="text">The smuggling of parts for chemical plants to produce toxic gases, that was uncovered a week ago might have been occurring to a much larger extent than previously expected. As reported by the Hamburg news magazine "Der Spiegel," several of the control devices were delivered not only to Libya, but also to Syria. At least 15 such control units are reported to have been exported to Libya illegally from Moenchengladbach with the help of a Belgian dummy firms. There is evidence that these deliveries were not exclusively destined for Libyan plants, but that some of them were transported on to Syria. An international arrest warrant has been issued for the German-Lebanese Balanian, the suspected leader of the business, who, according to "Der Spiegel," has also maintained close relations with potential buyers in Syria. Papers found in his apartment also point to former project leaders of the toxic gas plant in Rabda, Libya, which have organizing for the procuring of the control devices. The buyers have paid a total of roughly 3.2 million Marks for the technical supplies for their plants. Balanian appears to have run the business together with two German companies based in Moenchengladbach. His two German partners have been arrested, however, they deny to have known the purpose for which the control units were to be used. "Der Spiegel" further quotes a confidential report issued by the German secret service to the Chancellor's office in 1993. The report states that the export was only possible if the exporting parties provided export papers listing the correct contents. Thus, any export control seems to run aground quickly when it comes to skillfully set up ways of circumventing the law and to the strategic use of seemingly respectable front men and camouflage firms.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal board speaker for Buendnis 90/The Greens, Sager, has proposed the elimination of the separation of office and mandate in her party. In an interview with the radio station "Deutschlandradio Berlin" this morning, she said that the party office had to be as attractive as the party mandate. If this wasn't the case, the result would be a value loss for the party overall, said Sager. Today, she returns to Hamburg, after a two-year term in the party leadership.

<field name="text">The union for trade, bank, and insurance employees (HBV) has called for further strikes in the retail sector in North Rhine-Westphalia, today. A speaker for the HBV announced in Duesseldorf that the strikes will concentrate on the region surrounding Essen. On Tuesday, the German Federation of Unions had broken off its negotiations for some 500,000 employees during the sixth round. In contrast to the national union of employees, the HBV insists on additional pay of 55 per cent for work after 7:30 p.m. The unions reported that today some 1000 employees participated in the strikes, and thus caused severe interruptions in sales in the departments stores in question.  </field>

<field name="text">In the view of Frankfurt corruption expert Wolfgang Schaukensteiner, the German economical leaders are indifferent to the growing problems of corruption. Specifically, he called on industrial circles to abandon their indifference. He explained that the policy of "hear nothing, see nothing" was very prevalent in the leading layers of the industry, and he called the managers to finally address the problem. Schaukensteiner added that the companies themselves took losses because of the practice of corruption. The expert estimates that roughly 5 million Marks in bribes are spent in Germany each year. Most affected is the building sector. Schaukensteiner considers the governmental proposals to counteract corruption to be insufficient. They are especially missing laws concerning the siphoning off of profits, as the profits from illegal businesses are the Achilles' tendon of corrupt businesses. The district attorney remarked that corruption had to finally stop being lucrative.  </field>

It pointed out that half of all assets are owned by only ten per cent of the households, which it said to be completely distorted. DGB board member Geulich further stressed the uneven distribution of interest earnings. As little as two per cent of all interest-earning households received almost one third of all interest and dividends, explained Geulich.

<field name="text">This morning, the Frankfurt convention center opened its doors for the world's largest show of consumer goods. The former fall convention is now called "Tendencies." Through exhibition of numerous novelties, the suppliers hope to re-attract consumers. However, the number of German exhibitors has declined yet further compared to last year's number. 5000 suppliers from almost 90 countries are participating in the convention, which is organized around three main areas. One of them is "Domus and Lumina," meaning house and light. It includes gift ideas that focus on dining and the kitchen. The exhibitions range from trash containers to cultured pearls, from super flat flash lights to inflatable chairs. They include Christmas decorations, as well as machines for paining Easter eggs. One of the most expensive gift ideas is a model of the Frankfurt convention tower, made of pure rock crystal and steel, selling for 60,000 Marks. Expensive splendor is a major general trend in gift ideas. A new addition to the Frankfurt convention this year is a Gourmet Shop, which exhibits foods which are especially suited as gifts. In its report on the convention, the Munich IFO institute expresses modest optimism. Even if there is no overall turn for the better so far, there are good reasons to expect a general improvement in the economy.  </field>

<field name="text">According to the Frankfurt district attorney Peter Koehler, numerous children are being sexually abused and sold for pornographic photography in Germany. In an interview with the news magazine "FOCUS," Koehler said that on any given weekend, children were being sold by their parents at highway rest stops. Sexual abuse of children, as recently uncovered in Belgium, was equally possible in Germany, Koehler added. The investigators are aware that a large portion of child pornography is produced in Germany. Police and justice departments lack the personnel to protect children effectively. Koehler drew attention to the fact that currently 690 children are reported missing in Germany.  </field>

<field name="text">The Hamburg Reemtsma investigator Langendoerfer is going to be the new safety chair of the Volkswagen company. VW speaker Kocks verified that Langendoerfer will begin working for the company on October 1. Under Langendoerfer's leadership, Hamburg police had solved the case of the Reemtsma kidnapping, several months ago. Langendoerfer had been the center of attention because he had accused Hamburg Senator of the Interior Rocklage and police president Semerag, who has since resigned, of incompetence. VW reports that is has been spied upon with the help of very modern technology for months. Kocks announced today that on the test race track near Wolfsburg a hidden infrared camera had been discovered, which had taken pictures of the newest VW car models. The camera had been fully automated to take and send the pictures via satellite to an as of yet unknown recipient.  </field>

<field name="text">The newspaper "Welt am Sonntag" reports that German hospitals give in-patient treatment to significantly more people than necessary. The paper cites a study conducted by German health insurance companies, which was funded by the ministry for health. While a complete version of the report by the health insurance companies is not expected until the end of the year, experts consider the results from Schleswig-Holstein, Hesse, and Saxony-Anhalt, which have already been evaluated, to be representative. These results are now center of the discussion concerning savings measures in the health sector. The Schleswig-Holstein health insurance companies estimate that on average every tenth hospital in-patient could be treated as an out-patient; in urology the average is close to every fifth patient. Especially on Sundays there are many unnecessary hospitalizations. The Kiel speaker for the Association of Employee's Health Insurance Companies (VdAK) concluded that the emergency care units of the hospitals are not at all well organized. Another reason for the high number in hospitalizations are general practitioners, who prefer to refer their patients to hospitals, rather than to specialists. As a concrete example, the VdAK lists patients suffering from mild diabetes caused by old age. For this specific medical problem, the VdAK considers hospital stays of several days to be unnecessary in most cases. The data from Hesse implies as one of its most frequent examples the removal of screws and metal plates used in the reconstruction of broken bones. Also for chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer, in-patient treatment is usually not necessary, explained the Frankfurt speaker for the VdAK. If the currently evaluated data is reflected by the outcome of the studied from the other states, then ten to twenty per cent of the fourteen million people receiving in-patient treatment each year, could also be treated as out-patients, which would be significantly less expensive.  </field>

<field name="text">The fate of the 7 German tourists who had been abducted in Yemen only became clear this afternoon, when security forces announced that the hostages were free, and were supposed to arrive in the capital, San'a, this evening. A spokesman for the Foreign Office in Bonn confirmed the announcement. The German ambassador in San'a, Duchess Strachwitz (sp?), is supposed to have talked with one of the abducted men via telephone. Further details of the release are not yet known. It was announced yesterday that the drama was ended and the hostages freed; this later proved to be an error. The Germans had been abducted by approximately 50 armed Beduins in south Yemen at the beginning of last week.  </field>

<field name="text">Protests by miners and by opponents of the nuclear waste transport to Gorleben have led to heated exchanges in the Bundestag. Members of the governing coalition said during a special sitting of the parliament in Bonn that offences such as violating the mile-wide protest ban around the Bundestag, or acts of violence such as were seen recently in Gorleben must not be accepted. They accused the SPD of playing on the fears of miners and other citizens as a political tactic. The Opposition defended the rights of miners to defend themselves against threatened lay-offs.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Chancellor Kohl has expressed confidence that the dispute over subsidies for coal mining can be settled at talks with the chairman of the mining union (IG Bergbau), Berger, tomorrow. Kohl told leading representatives of the economy in Munich that he wanted to negotiate the stages of the planned cuts to the subsidies again. The leaders of the CDU/CSU and the FDP in the Bundestag, Schaeuble and Solms, had also already indicated that they were open to compromise. The speed of the reduction is to be discussed again, even if the long-term goal of halving coal subsidies, to approximately 4 billion Marks a year, by the year 2005 remained. The miners interrupted their protests in Bonn and pulled back to Cologne, where the union set up a city of tents for the 5,000-8,000 miners. However, they want to return to Bonn if tomorrow's talks with the Chancellor do not result in an agreement. A demonstration in Cologne is planned for this evening. At a protest in Bonn, SPD parliamentary leader Scharping said this morning that his party would only resume talks with the coalition about tax reform when the future of coal mining without lay-offs was assured. The chairman of the IG Metall union, Zwickel, called on the Federal Government to yield in the conflict over coal subsidies. Otherwise, he said, there would be flare-ups of social unrest which would not be restricted to mining.  </field>

<field name="text">As of July 1 of this year, automobiles will be taxed higher the more pollution they put into the atmosphere. The mediation committee of Bundestag and Bundesrat agreed to a compromise according to which the owners of environmentally burdensome older autos will be required to pay more and more. Lower taxes are intended for vehicles which meet the most current European norms. The Federal Government wants to abolish the vehicle tax in favour of the oil tax. However, since the vehicle tax generates revenue for the states, and the oil tax is federal, no agreement has been reached in that regard. Environment Minister Merkel welcomed the committee's agreement, anticipating that it would now be possible to drive vehicles without a catalytic converter out of circulation through market forces.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Chancellor Kohl has announced investments worth 25 billion Marks to create jobs in the construction industry. In a top-level discussion with Germany's largest business associations during the International Trades Fair, in Munich, Kohl said the federal cabinet would discuss the measures in the coming week. The money is to come, to a large extent, from the funds of the Reconstruction Loan Corporation, as well as the German Equalization Bank. The Chancellor also called on the SPD to resume talks about tax reform. Kohl said that he expected of the SPD that they should resume the negotiations quickly, without playing in partisan tactics. The government's social and tax policies were at the center of the talks in Munich, in which the Trades President Phillip (sp?), President Stihl of the Council of German Chambers of Commerce, President Hundt of the employers' association, and Industry President Henkel took part, in addition to Kohl. In Berlin, several thousand construction workers demonstrated for the third day in a row against increasing unemployment in the industry, and also against low pay.  </field>

<field name="text">The IG Metall union and the employers' association Gesamtmetall began negotiations over part-time work for older workers and a reform of the general wage agreement this afternoon. On the table is a suggestion from the union chairman, Riester (sp?). His model for part-time work for older workers has employees working full time for 5 years beginning when they are 55 years old, and then not at all for a further 5 years, while receiving 85 percent of their wages for all ten years, until mandatory retirement. The employers have rejected the suggestion as being too expensive. The president of Gesamtmetall, Stumpfe, said that he expected the negotiations to be difficult, and that a new agreement on the wage contract system would probably not be possible before the end of the year. Union leader Zwickel said that an agreement on part-time work for older workers would be required before any progress could be made on the wage contracts.  </field>

<field name="text">Hamburg/Bad Gandersheim. The president of the Chamber of Doctors in Hamburg, Montgomeri (sp?), has sharply criticized Federal Health Minister Seehofer's latest bill intended to curb costs in the health system. He said on Deutschlandradio Berlin that the sick were having their pockets picked, while employers and the healthy were "doing fine". Montgomeri, who is also the chairman of the Marburg chapter of the Association of Hospital Doctors, also objected to the so-called "hard case" regulations. He said that those affected would have to collect documents all year long and give them to their insurance company, which would drive administrative costs through the roof. Doctors, other health care providers, and patients protested today in Bad Gandersheim, in Lower Saxony, against health cuts. About 2,000 people took part in the demonstration. They called for solidarity with the sick and with those working in the health care system. The coalition's bill provides for an increase of 5 Marks across the board in the percent excess for members of the state insurance companies, probably as of July 1. Also, "hard case" regulations for those with low incomes and the chronically ill are to be introduced.  </field>

<field name="text">The Regional Court today reconstructed the fatal fire in a refugees' residence in Luebeck last year with the help of a computer simulation. The simulation supported the view of the expert witness, Achilles, that the fire began in the entryway of the house. The public prosecutor is claiming that the accused, Eid, set the fire on the second floor of the building. The Federal Criminal Office attested that scenario, also using a computer simulation. The fire killed 10 people and injured 38 in January of last year.  </field>

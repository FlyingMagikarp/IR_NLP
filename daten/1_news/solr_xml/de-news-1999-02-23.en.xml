<field name="text">Four months after the new government came into office, the first red-green budget bill started a hefty exchange of words between government and opposition in the Bundestag. Starting the four-day debate, Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine said, the budget was in line with the main targets of the red-green government, to fight unemployment and to increase economic growth. In contrast to  FDP and CDU/CSU, the government would relieve families and the small business sector, said the minister who introduced the 1999 budget. Lafontaine called for further reductions of the interest rates  by the European Central Bank and wage demands in line with the economic productivity. CDU/CSU and FDP accused the coalition of lack of plan, a wrong policy and inability in craftsmanship. Vice-president of the CDU-CSU faction Friedrich Merz said the budget bill was a document of helplessness. Repeated touch-ups, especially in tax politics, suggested that Lafontaine could not cope with the subject. The CDU politician added that it was obvious that SPD and Greens would soon raise the sales tax.  </field>

<field name="text">The riots of PKK supporters after the arrest of separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan were completely unexpected by the EU member states, said Germany's Interior Minister Otto Schily after a meeting of EU ministers of interior affairs. As a consequence, Schily and his colleagues agreed to improve the information exchange about PKK activities. According to Schily, radical Kurds shall no longer be able to plan riots without being detected. Further, violent offenders would have to expect expulsion. He warned again to make a connection between the latest riots with the planned change in the citizenship code. This was rejected by Erwin Marschewski, CDU. A foreigner with double citizenship who had been convicted could not be expelled. Mr. Marschewski called for the rigorous expulsion of all violent Kurds. Turkey had assured that the human rights of the expelled would be honoured.  </field>

<field name="text">One day after the SPD, also CDU/CSU announced a harder approach in fighting crime. CDU/CSU presented today in Munich their election platform concerning the interior security. The platform stipulates that the maximum penalty for youths be raised from ten to fifteen years. Young adults under 21 will be subjected more often to the adult penal code. The Union parties also stipulate that criminal foreigners be expelled quickly. Genes of repeated offenders shall be registered in a federal database and video surveillance of residences shall be permitted. At the presentation, CSU leader Theo Waigel criticized corresponding concepts of the SPD. They were a turn-about and not credible, especially regarding the youth crime. The police unions also criticized the SPD platform. It was understandable but putting it into practice was doubtful.  </field>

The Munich authorities accuse his parents to have failed in his education and therefore the parents are expelled along with their son.  </field>

<field name="text">The cabinet has endorsed the budget drafts fro 1997 ad 1998. Finance Minister Theo Waigel has called the drafts 'documents of a consequent policy of consolidation'. The planned additional costs had to be coped with without additional savings because the Bundesrat would not endorse the saving measures. Half of all ministries will have to do with less money next year. More money has only been planned for pensions, interests, and the move to Berlin. DM850 million have been scheduled for next year alone for the construction of the controversial Eurofighter jet. The amount has apparently been accepted by the Liberals. The Finance Minister also defended his supplementary budget for this year. There was no alternative to increasing the debt by DM17 billion. Further drastic cuts were impossible to implement because of the resistance of the SPD-lead Bundesrat. Tax increases were out of the question, too, because they would weaken economic growth and employment. Earlier, the cabinet had endorsed as expected the additional budget for the current the next year. Accordingly, the amount of new debts will total DM71.2 billion. This is clearly more than the amount of planned investments. In this case the constitution demands that the parliament endorses the disturbance of the economic balance at large. For 1998 the budget plan provides government expenses totalling DM461 billion, new debts will be reduced to about DM58 billion. The medium-term financial planning till the year 2001 provides a reduction of annual new debts to DM47 billion. This has also been endorsed by the cabinet. The government assumes that the number of unemployed decreases by 100,000 next year. Theo Waigel also assumes that the total debts will be no more than 3.0 percent of the gross national product and that Germany will just make the grade to be admitted to the Euro. In their annual economic report the government still assumed a rate of 2.9 percent. Oppositional politicians have criticized the government's budget plans. SPD finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier called the budget drafts the desperate attempt of the government to survive with patches and emergency operations. Ms. Matthaeus-Maier called Finance Minister Waigel a Debt Minister who is close to bankruptcy. According to Ms. Matthaeus-Maier the government could save at the Transrapid high-speed train and the Eurofighter jet. National president of Alliance 90/Greens Ms. Roestl (sp?) stated the government was plugging budget holes with credits that are on the verge of unconstitionality. The government itself was responsible for the disturbance of the economic balance at large.  </field>

<field name="text">A dust cloud has been released into the town of Friesenheim from a chemical accident at BASF. A spokesman for the firm said that about 50 kg of polyethylene wax had been accidentally released, but this product was not harmful for people or the environment and could be washed off without problem using water. The cause of the accident was an overheated production reactor. The chemicals were released by an emergency air release valve and spread over the area of Friesenheim as grey fluff or dust.

<field name="text">The regional court of Hamburg has ruled that the news magazine "Focus" has to pay compensation for the collapse of the Modi Bank (sp?) of Hamburg. According to the judgement, Focus are obliged to compensate for all damages resulting from an article published in the magazine in January 1995. The exact amount will be established in a separate trial. Banking experts estimate that this could amount to more than ten million marks. Focus had promoted a report entitled "Exclusive - Hamburg private bank in trouble; customers fear loss of money", which hadn't actually been concerned with the bank itself, but rather with the financial situation of its chairman of the board, Ahrend G. Modi (sp?). As a result of this article, customers of the Modi Private Bank had withdrawn their capital resulting in the bank eventually having to close down. When Focus has paid, the money will be put into a compensation fund for bank depositors who have as not yet received compensation. The legal representation for the Focus magazine has announced that they will be appealing against the judgement.  </field>

<field name="text"> The public prosecutor's office has abandoned its investigation against the head of the tax division in the ministry of finance in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Mr. Merkle.  There had been indications that Mr. Merkle had leaked confidential information related to his work at the tax office. Today the public prosecutor's office withdrew their accusation that Mr. Merkle had warned Mannheim concert manager Matthias Hoffmann before his offices were searched because of suspected tax evasion.  However, the public prosecutor's office still believes that while out drinking with his friends in a Stuttgart pub, Mr. Merkle had shared that Mr. Hoffmann had been apprehended.  Mr. Hoffmann was in New York City at the time, but returned to Germany early when he received the news.  In the meantime, his offices and his apartment had been searched by the police.  Hoffmann himself was not apprehended until three months later, but released on bail. The investigation against him is still underway. The public prosecutor's office announced today that the investigation against tax officer Mr. Merkle now had to be abandoned, since neither the ministry of finance, nor the concert manager Mr. Hoffmann filed a suit. The Green party in the Stuttgart state parliament was outraged today at Finance Minister Maier-Vorfelder's decision not to sue.  Parliamentary group leader Fritz Kuhn announced that the minister's refusal to agree to a suit could not be tolerated.  </field>

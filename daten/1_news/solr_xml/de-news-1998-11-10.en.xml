<field name="text">Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will make combating mass-unemployment the main focus of his government. In his first executive statement before the Parliament, Schroeder also announced a comprehensive modernisation of the economy and the government. Tax reform, reduction of payroll taxes, investment in the future and wage policy must be balanced in a sensible way. Schroeder stressed that social policies implemented by the government led by Helmut Kohl and the CDU, such as cuts in pensions, health services and salary payments during long-term illnesses, as well as loosened protection against unlawful firing, would be reversed. Schroeder also stated that all expenditures would have to be curbed because of the high national debt. Kohl's government did not leave behind a well-ordered house, as they claimed, rather budget risks than run in the billions of DM. Regarding foreign policy, Schroeder said that his government would continue to set the pace in European reforms. Opposition Leader Wolfgang Schaeuble said Schroeder's executive statement had no substance. In his opinion, the SPD and the Greens were moving backwards into a false past. Business associations feel that the tax and energy policies of the new government will endanger jobs. Environmental groups think that the ecological reforms do not go far enough. The German Federation of Trade Unions welcomed the executive statement as proof of political change.  </field>

<field name="text">The tax and pension plans of the federal government have sparked a new debate. Employers criticise the proposed tax reform, despite changes already made, as hostile to the middle class and detrimental to jobs. Employers also reject the idea of an earlier retirement age. The Association of Pension Plan Providers (Rentenversicherungstraeger) also expressed scepticism of the pension reform plans. In contrast to the employers, pension providers believe that the plan gives businesses the advantage.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government intends to examine the possibility of forgiving loans of the countries devastated by hurricane Mitch. In the interim, the Federal Finance Ministry has released an additional 10 million DM to help rebuild the Central American countries. The World Bank is supporting the countries with immediate assistance in the amount of 330 million DM. After an emergency meeting, the presidents of the affected Central American countries made a plea for international aid in rebuilding. The scope of the catastrophe, they said, exceeds the means of their countries.  </field>

<field name="text">Three PDS-delegates which were found to have had a some connection with the Stasi, are allowed to continue being members of the Saxonian Landtag. The Saxonian constitutional court in Leipzig turned down the motion of the state parliament to deprive their seats in the Landtag. The judges did not examine the case in that matter since the motion of the delegates had been handed in too late. According to the judges, the motion should have been handed in immediately after the last election, because their collaboration with the Stasi had been discovered in the first legislative period of the Landtag.  </field></doc></add>

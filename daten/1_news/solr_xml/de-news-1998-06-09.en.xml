<field name="text">For the first time in two years, the number of unemployed persons fell below the figure of a year ago in May. At the end of May, some 4.2 million people were registered unemployed in Germany, 220,000 less than in April, and 58,000 less compared to one year ago. The unemployment rate dropped from 11.4% to 10.9%. President of the Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda said it is not the time yet for an all-clear signal. The down turn in unemployment figures can be attributed to the usual economic recovery in Spring, a general upswing in the economic cycle, and to an expansion of job creation schemes. The situation in the New States [former East-Germany] remained precarious. Moreover, the state of the apprenticeship market continues to be difficult - in Germany a total of 220,000 apprenticeships are missing.  The job market in Baden-Wuerttemberg looks much better. In May the unemployment rate fell to 6.9%. The President of the state's Labour Office, Mr Schade, announced an upturn.  </field>

<field name="text">Russia's President Boris Yeltsin has spoken out against a possible military intervention in Kosovo. At the end of two days of German-Russian consultations, Mr Yeltsin said a direct interference in the conflict involved the danger that the conflict spread across the border lines. Mr Yeltsin announced he will meet the Yugoslavian President, Mr Milosevic, in person to try to convince him to give in. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed with Mr Yeltsin that it was necessary to prevent another bloodshed in Kosovo.  Mr Kohl and Mr Yeltsin called the German-Russian relationship as being excellent. Since the past year, Germany has been Russia's biggest trading partner. In the morning, Mr Yeltsin had received present President of the Bundesrat [upper house of parliament] and SPD's candidate for chancellorship Gerhard Schroeder for breakfast. SPD parliamentary faction leader Rudolf Scharping also took part in the meeting.  </field>

<field name="text">More and more young people in Germany would not hesitate to vote for a right-extremist party.

<field name="text">The German federation of unions (DGB) have announced at their federal convention a more critical analysis of the policies of the Federal government. DGB's head Dieter Schulte said the unions do not shy away from a conflict with the Federal government in order to achieve a profound policy change in Germany. At the presentation of the business report, Mr Schulte said the coalition government and employers have destroyed in an act of political stupidity the "Alliance for jobs" called for by the unions. Therefore it is them who are responsible for mass unemployment. The decrease in unemployment figures in May would not represent a turn on the job market, according to Mr Schulte. The DGB will continnue its massive intervention in the campaign for the general elections [in autumn]. Leading unionists called for another "Alliance for jobs" at the convention.  The convention reelected Mr Schulte with a great majority for another four years as head of DGB. Mr Schulte received 289 out of 360 votes, that is almost 73% of all votes. Mr Schulte's deputy, Ms Engelen-Kefer was reelected with almost 82% of the votes. A change of the by-laws to move the head quarters of the federation from Duesseldorf to Berlin did not get the necessary 2/3 majority.  </field>

<field name="text">The SPD is becoming increasingly nervous two weeks before the elections in Lower Saxony. A discussion over the candidate for Chancellor was renewed again after the Party Left voiced their concerns in a paper over the possible candidate Gerhard Schroeder. According to the German magazine "Der Spiegel", SPD head Lafontaine apparently cooperated with the left wing of the party more than he admits. Prominent Social Democrats are therefore now calling for unity. This is especially troublesome for Bavarian SPD head Renate Schmidt. Instead of combining their strengths for the upcoming elections in Lower Saxony as well as in the Federal Government, her party members are wasting their time with their tiresome quarrels over the candidate for Chancellor. During an election event in Braunschweig, Schmidt stressed the party priorities. The SPD has to replace the present government coalition. According to Renate Schmidt, whether they achieve this goal with either Schroeder or Lafontaine as their candidate is unimportant. After all, said Schmidt, both are classes above a drained, weak Kohl. The Social Democrats were also called to order by some of their most prominent former politicians. In an interview with "Bild am Sonntag", Hans-Juergen Wischnewski warned his colleagues that whoever takes part in the personal quarrels aids in making a political turnover in Bonn impossible. Such undiplomatic behavior is not unusual, according to the former Bremen SPD mayor Hans Koschnik. Whenever the SPD looks good in the public eye, he said in an interview, some of the party members do everything they can do ruin this impression. The Union calmly observes this discussion. Their candidate is Helmut Kohl. A new discussion in the Union cannot be ruled out even by the regional head of the CSU Michael Glos. Glos stated in the news magazine "Der Spiegel" that stupidity by individuals cannot be avoided in a large people's party.  </field>

<field name="text">The Christian Democratic Union is building a front against the labour union election campaign that started today. As a result, the employer organization of the CDU demanded the resignation of IG Metall boss Zwickel.  Federal employment minister Bluem demanded that the membership fees could be used for better purposes than an election campaign. The CDU social politician Louven called the action an open election aid for the SPD. The DGB stressed that the campaign is oriented around material themes and is not connected with any election recommendations.  </field>

<field name="text">The Baden-Wuerttemberg SPD has gotten once again to the front of the Bundestag election with their candidate, Bundestag representative Hertha Daeubler-Gmehlin. The 54 year old lawyer from Tuebingen has been placed at first  place on the regional list in the SPD regional party convention in Karlsruhe. However, with 78 percent her success is everything but good, since she has no  opponent at first place. Hertha Daeubler-Gmehlin is pleased anyway. "People like  me, people with edge, are never elected unanimously." But that also means that the party favors other candidates as well. For example, the environmental researcher Ernst-Ulrich von Weizsaecker, new SPD candidate from Stuttgart, has a sensational 95.8 percent and is ranked at ninth place. The first 25 places on the regional list are assured seats in the Bundestag. There was no fight for places on the list. The state party conference elected the Waibling representative Hermann Scheer for second place and Rottweil parliamentarian Klaus Kirschner for third place - just like four years ago.  </field>

<field name="text">The Bavarian Green Party will enter the Landtag elections for this first  time with a prominent top politic personality in the Fall. The regional delegates convention in Coburg elected the 48 year old party head Ruth Paulich from Upper Bavaria. The decision for a top candidate, which hasn't existed in this form for the Greens in Bavaria, occurred without any real fight. The supporters of the decision pointed out that the other parties also only enter the elections, which are highly influenced by the media, by pushing just one personality. The opponents argued that naming one main candidate goes against the traditional view of the Green Party.  </field>

<field name="text">Stricter conditions for unemployment came into force at the beginning of this year. The unemployed must appear at the "Arbeitsamt" (labour office) every twelve weeks to not lose their entitlements for unemployment benefits or aid. The Federal Labour Ministry found this to be an unreasonable demand for the sick, pregnant, elderly or handicapped. They are now viewed as exceptions to the rule. The rule that unemployed persons appear every three months at the "Arbeitsamt" has  been in force throughout Germany since January 1st. Whoever did not appear by the authorities legally lost his or her salary entitlements. This is no longer valid for people over 55 years of age, people with handicaps, people who are sick, and pregnant  women. A speaker for the Federal Labour Ministry confirmed this afternoon in "B5-aktuell". This exception resolution can be traced back to an initiative of the special committee for labour and social services. The committee felt that the ruling, which has been in effect since the beginning of this year, was unreasonable for the above-mentioned groups. The Ministry immediately encouraged the Federal Labour Office to immediately apply this ruling in practice. The change does not exclude the right of the authorities to invite unemployed persons talks on finding jobs and personal consultations.  </field>

<field name="text">Despite a clear no from the Bonn Coalition, companies and economic officials insist on a decrease in premiums for "Pflegeversicherung" (care insurance). In this way, a clear signal could be sent to decrease the benefit contributions paid by employers. The FDP demanded a decrease based on the federal reserve, however talks broke down when the union refused to cooperate.  </field>

<field name="text">Police in Korbach found a kilogram of an especially dangerous, homemade explosive during a search of several apartments in the city in North Hesse. Background information of this finding is still unclear. According to the investigators, the suspects that were arrested had nothing to do with right or left wing extremist groups. Five arrests, a search of four apartments and garages and a kilogram of highly explosive fuel. That is the result of the activities last night in Korbach. A young woman and young man were arrested in front of an apartment house. They had just left the apartment in which the homemade, highly dangerous fuel was found. Three further men were also arrested who were involved in making the material and planned on selling it. A similar material was found a night ago in Kassel. Based on information from the state police in Wiesbaden, one of the materials found is acetone peroxide. The police ended up in Korbach while following leads regarding the material, which can be highly dangerous when mixed with other substances. Apparently the sale of a large amount of the explosive was to have occurred there. The sale was stopped by a special police action that led to the arrests. The police have excluded political reasons. The entire operation is probably involved with a large drug ring in Hesse. The police received a concrete tip about this probable association.  </field>

<field name="text">Approximately 1,500 family members, friends and colleagues remembered the Saxon customs officers, who were murdered on the German-Polish border in Ludwigsdorf, with a funeral service. Federal Financial Minister Waigel offered his deepest regards to the surviving friends and family in the Goerlitz town hall. He also included the families of both customs officers shot in Constance. As the representative employer of the murdered authorities, Waigel mentioned the opening of the borders and liberalness; however, he also called for an increase in the fight against crime.  </field></doc></add>

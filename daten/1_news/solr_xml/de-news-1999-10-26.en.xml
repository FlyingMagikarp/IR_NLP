<field name="text">Buendnis90/Gruene still consider the delivery of a Leopard II tank to Turkey a wrong decision, said executive spokesperson Gunda Roestel. Tonight, SPD and Greens have resolved their dispute about the tank delivery. SPD faction leader Peter Struck said the coalition was not in danger. Now, SPD and Greens want to tighten rules for arms exports. According to the Greens the most important criterion should be the adherence to the Human Rights. Faction spokesperson Kerstin Mueller said, that was also a requirement for admitting Turkey to the EU. The PDS criticized the Greens' giving in on the sample tank question the slaughtering of a sacred cow. The PDS member of parliament Heidi Lippmann Kasten said those who engaged in a war in Kosovo on behalf of the human rights apparently now also are allowed to deliver tanks to enforce the human rights. CDU and CSU reproached the government with on the one hand offering Turkey candidate status for joining the European Union and on the other hand questioning the co-operation when it comes to a small arms export.  </field>

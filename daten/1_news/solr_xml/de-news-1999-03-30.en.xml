<field name="text">Russian premier Primakov's try to act as mediator in the Kosovo conflict was to no avail. Chancellor Schroeder said he could not see a basis for a political Kosovo solution in Yugoslav president Milosevic's pronouncements. He stressed this was his personal opinion, but he was sure his NATO partners would think alike. Following a one hour meeting with Primakov, Schroeder said the main point was stopping the Kosovo genocide. He added that he had made Primakov understand that the one aim of the NATO bombings was to forestall a humanitarian catastrophe. Defense minister Scharping had stated in advance of the Primakov - Milosevic talks that the bombings would stop only if and when Yugoslav troops were pulled out of Kosovo and the Yugoslav president showed clear willingness to sign a peace treaty. Primakov had spent six hours today talking with Milosevic. Arriving in Bonn, he said Milosevic was willing to talk provided NATO stopped the bombings.  </field>

<field name="text">Mr. Penner, chairman of the Bundestag internal affairs committee, is doubtful about the feasibility of an agreement among EU member states regarding fair distribution of Kosovo refugees. In an interview to the daily "Frankfurter Rundschau", the SPD politician said any hope in that direction would be negligence. Should minister for internal affairs Schily succeed in establishing an inter-European refugee policy, he would be ripe to appear on the stage as a magician, Penner said. Most countries were hoping to manage to steer clear of refugees. Baden-Wuerttemberg's minister for internal affairs, Schaeuble, this morning had demanded a fair distribution of the burden among German states and within the EU. According to the UN refugee organization UNHCR, tens of thousands of Kosovians are on the run. A UNHCR spokesman said over radio Deutschlandfunk that it became ever clearer that Serbs were systematically expelling Kosovo-Albanians. The number of refugees would foreseeably rise within the days to come. Albania's ambassador to Germany had gone public on ARD-TV this morning asking for financial and humanitarian help for coping with refugees from Kosovo.  </field>

<field name="text">The salary negotiations for approx. 470,000 bank employees broke down after 12 hours of negotiations. According to both sides, no agreement could be reached regarding work on Saturdays, although they did agree on a general opening. The unions rejected the demands of the employers to make Saturday a regular working day. The question of the 13th month salary [usually considered vacation and holiday pay] was also a point of contention. The employers are demanding expanding working hours to include Saturdays as well as cutting the 13th month salary. The unions rejected these demands, however, they announced that they were in agreement with the employers' salary requirements. The employers had offered a pay raise of 3.1 percent. After the renewed breakdown in the negotiations, the unions have announced that they intend to continue their strikes.  </field>

<field name="text">Officials of the forbidden Kurdish worker party PKK do not have any right to asylum in Germany. The German Supreme Administrative Court in Berlin turned down the asylum requests and special protection against deportation of two Kurds. However, according to the court's judgement, the PKK officials can only be deported if they are not being threatened with torture or a death sentence in Turkey. In another principle judgement, the Supreme Administrative Court determined that PKK supporters can not lose their deportation protection because they have participated in forbidden demonstrations or regularly donate money for the Kurdish organization. The CDU/CSU parliamentary fraction demanded that PKK officials be immediately deported from Germany after the judgement was announced. A spokesman for Amnesty International explained that the court had clarified that normal sympathizers can not lose asylum.  </field>

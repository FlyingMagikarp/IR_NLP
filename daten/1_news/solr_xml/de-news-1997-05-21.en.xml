<field name="text">The federal cabinet today agreed to a new plan to support the economic development of Eastern Germany. Economic Minister Rexrodt explained that despite the current budgetary situation, development monies would be maintained at present levels after 1999. Special tax deductions would be abolished in the future, according to the plan, but investment payments would double. The plan provides for approximately DM 5.7 billion a year in development funds. After 1998, federal support monies are to be concentrated in areas where jobs could be created, namely in heavy industry and the service branch.  </field>

<field name="text">The leadership of the SPD has announced at the Innovation Convention that it would double spending on research, education, and science within 5 years if the SPD formed the next federal government. Party leader Lafontaine criticized the current government for a lack of readiness to modernize, saying that conservatives viewed increasing globalization in the marketplace as a threat, and used the fear of that threat to implement faulty economic thinking and wealth redistribution policies detrimental to the vast majority of the population. Lafontaine said that globalization should be an opportunity for Germany, something which must be understood as an opportunity to cooperate with others, and that the SPD wanted to use that opportunity to increase prosperity and to create new, secure jobs. Lower Saxony's Premier Schroeder demanded that the basic wage contracts be reformed: "The employees' representation on the factory committees must have more chance to act on the peculiarities of their companies; working with the unions, we will fight for this measure of flexibility and implement it together."  </field>

<field name="text">The first battle in the war over the permanent nuclear storage facility in Morsleben, Saxony-Anhalt, has been won by opponents to the station. The Federal Administrative Court has ruled that the Higher Administrative Court in Magdeburg must look into the threat to their health that the plaintiffs fear. With the ruling, the federal judges annulled an earlier ruling from Magdeburg. The facility was put into operation by the socialist government of then-East Germany. The federal government would like it to continue accepting nuclear waste until probably 2003, possibly even 2005.  </field>

<field name="text">The judgement against former East German border guard commander Baumgarten and 5 others generals is legally valid.

According to the Region Court, they had helped in working out Baumgarten's orders to use firearms to prevent unauthorized border crossings.  </field>

<field name="text">Brussels, Belgium. The European Commission has declared German subsidies to the SKETT mechanical engineering company in Magdeburg to be illegal. A spokesman for the Commission said that the DM 600 million given to the company, which has since gone bankrupt, must be paid back to the German authorities. It is unclear, however, whether this demand can actually be satisfied, given the bankruptcy. On the other hand, the European Commission has approved approximately DM 500 million in subsidies for the shipyards of the former Vulkan group. A spokesman for the Commission said that that subsidy was in line with EU regulations.  </field>

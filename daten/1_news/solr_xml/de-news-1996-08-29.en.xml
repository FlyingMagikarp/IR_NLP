<field name="text">Today, the Bundestag again dealt with the welfare laws relating to the savings measures.  After the mediation committee between Bundestag and Bundesrat [Upper House of Parliament] last Monday had rejected the law and demanded that corresponding resolutions be annulled, the coalition's majority of CDU/CSU and FDP today overruled the committee's vote.  The debate was scheduled to last four hours.  During the parliamentary debate, the parties of the opposition accused the government of running a course of confrontation.  The SPD representative Dressler said in Bonn today that the measures are economically wrong and threaten the coherence of society.  In the opinion of The Greens' spokesperson for social policy, Ms. Fischer, the government itself has caused the precarious situation on the job market. Economics Minister Rexrodt defended the austerity plans for which there are no alternatives.  Employment Minister Bluem accused the SPD of blocking policy and of unwillingness to compromise.  </field>

<field name="text">The representative of the Autonomous Palestinian Authority to Bonn, Mr. Franji, has urged the Israeli Government to more sensitivity and responsibility in view of the peace process in the Near East.  He said on Deutschlandfunk radio this morning that a meeting between Israel's Minister President Netanyahu and the Palestinian President Arafat is critically advised, given the current tensions.  Franji views the demolition of a Palestinian care center for disabled people in East Jerusalem as a sign that Netanyahu somewhat disdains the Autonomous Palestinian Rule.  Franji continued saying that in this situation, Arafat should make it clear that the Palestinians' patience has reached its limits and that they are not willing to yield in the questions of Jerusalem and of the expansion of Jewish settlements.  Arafat had called for a general strike to protest against Israel's measures.  Stores and offices remained closed for four hours this morning, not only affecting the West Jordan territories and the Gaza strip but also East Jerusalem.  </field>

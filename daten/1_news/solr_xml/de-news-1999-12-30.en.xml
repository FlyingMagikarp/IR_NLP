<field name="text">Shattered construction company Holzmann plans to reduce its number of jobs by 3.000 in order to become healthier. A sale of shares will cause 2.000 further Holzmann employees to get a new employer. Holzmann chairman Hinrich said during a shareholder's meeting that the company needed a new chance after the almost-bankruptcy at the end of November. Rehabilitaions plans also include a so-called 'capital-cut'. This means that the basic capital will be reduced from around 300 to around DM 12bn, and that, subsequently, it will be stocked up with new shares. Initially, this will bring losses to shareholders. However, they have reached a majority decision on these plans.  </field>

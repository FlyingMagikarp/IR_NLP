<field name="text">The Greens Party delegates met at Erfurt for a 3-day meeting about the elections to the European parliament. Ms Roestel, spokesperson for the executive, kicked off the debate by asking for more social justice and democracy in Europe. She was for a thorough reform of the EU plus giving the the European parliament more clout. She also said the CDU/CSU's campaign against dual citizenship was "setting bad anti-European signals". In many states in Europe dual citizenship was something taken for granted. Currently some 600 delegates are discussing the candidates for the elections to the European parliament. Ms Ruehle, the party's former federal manager, allegedly is on top of the short-list. The contentious debate about reforms of structures, however, was postponed until tomorrow. Before the meeting got under way, Foreign Minister Fischer and Environment Minister Trittin, had asked for one of the two managers at the top of the party to be 'dis-established'. This drew some flak from leading female Greens politicians who felt this attempt was directed against women.  </field>

<field name="text">State and federal ministers for internal affairs agree on how to deal with violent offenders belonging to the banned Kurdish PKK party. After meeting with the 16 state ministers, federal minister Schily said that violence similar to what had happened a fortnight ago would have to be avoided. Kurdish offenders would have to get a taste of law enforcement, and if required, even face deportation to Turkey. The SPD-politician stressed, however, that constitutional and human rights would limit deportations drastically. Several hundred persons showed up in Berlin, Erfurt and Aurich, to peacefully demonstrate for the release of the head of the PKK, Mr Oecalan.  </field>

<field name="text">President Clinton had talks with Italian head of state, Mr D'Alema, about paying damages to the dependents of the victims killed when a US-fighter plane severed a cable-car's cable, though he would not comment tonight, according to the White House. Yesterday's acquittal by a US court still raises plenty of eyebrows. Mr D'Alema had voiced criticism against the US military court's verdict. Previously the mayor of Burgstaedt/Saxony, Mr Naumann, had asked the US to pay adequate damages to the victims' dependents. Seven of the twenty victims were from Burgstaedt.  </field>

<field name="text">According to government spokesperson Reinhardt, the question of how to pay for reforms in the agricultural sector will stay on the agenda for the Agenda 2000 negotiations. Ms Reinhard said that the states opposing that would have to come up with plans of their own, on how to stabilise European spending for agricultural purposes. France's minister Glavany did not quite get what Ms Reinhard was on about. Yesterday, when talking to his offsider Mr Funke, he had been led to believe that this issue had already been dealt with. The idea is to have the members states chip in, so Germany would be less of a net payer. This strategy obviously would hurt France - who in the past tended to be more on the receiving end.  </field>

<field name="text">Dual citizenship is expected to become an option for children born to foreigners as well as long-time foreign residents. According to a discussion paper by Mr Schily, federal minister for internal affairs, children born in Germany to foreign residents should be able to apply for dual citizenship until they make up their minds which one they want to keep once they turn 23. Dual citizenship would also become an option for residents who have been in Germany for 30 years. Next Tuesday the coalition parties will talk about this draft, together with Chancellor Schroeder  </field></doc></add>

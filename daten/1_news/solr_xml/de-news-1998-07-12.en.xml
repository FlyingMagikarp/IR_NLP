<field name="text">In the dispute regarding future financing of the EU budget, German Minister of Finance Theo Waigel has rejected demands by Southern European states. Portugal and Greece support the proposition by Spain to calculate contributions based on the per-capita income of a member state. Mr. Waigel told the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag" that is completely unrealistic. This would mean that Germany would have to contribute up to 8 billion Marks more. Mr. Waigel stressed that he will lobby hard to reduce the burden on Germany. With a net contribution of 22 billion Marks, Germany contributes the most European Union coffers.  </field>

<field name="text">According to experts, the risks of radiation are higher than was believed so far. They say that the legal limits have to be tightened. The laws defining those limits have been based on incorrect data. Radiation experts have pointed out that present limits were set in the 50s. At that time it was not known that low doses of radiation can cause cancer. New insights from Hiroshima, nuclear tests and the reactor accident of Chernobyl have not been taken into account when the limits were put into law.  </field>

<field name="text">The special fee which members of public health insurances for the maintenance of hospitals have to pay can be deducted from taxes. A spokesman of the Ministry of Finance confirmed the validity of a newspaper report today in Bonn which claims that the so-called hospital emergency fund of 20 Marks can be deducted from annual taxes in the same way health insurance premiums are deducted. The surcharge has to be paid in 1997, 1998 and 1999 by approximately 40 million medically insured.

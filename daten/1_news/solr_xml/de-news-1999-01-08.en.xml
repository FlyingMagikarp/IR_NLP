<field name="text">Today the CDU-executive met behind closed doors, overshadowed by the party-internal bickering about the reform of the law on (dual) citizenship. Items on the 3-day event's agenda: finding out why they lost the last federal elections, and determining what they were going to do while in opposition. But the main item will probably be the planned collection of signatures against a change to the citizenship laws, providing for dual citizenship. As late as this afternoon, the CSU-party had asked the CDU for a decision on this matter. Head of the CDU-party and their parliamentary group Schaeuble asked for a decision in principle. He thought that details then could be worked out with the sister-party (CSU)   </field>

<field name="text">Winter caused the number of unemployed to rise above the 4 million mark - for the first time since the change in government after the elections. Head of the Federal Labour Office (Bundesanstalt fuer Arbeit) Jagoda put the blame on the extremely cold weather, causing close to 4.2 million people to be out of work as of December. The unemployment rate now stands at 10.9%, up from 10.2%.  Reasons for the substantial rise: on the one hand, work-schemes for about 60,000 people finished in December; on the other hand, mainly construction workers and others working outside had to go on the dole due to the very cold weather conditions. Mr Jagoda, however, said that 1998 had been a good year for the German economy. Economic activity had been better, and for the first time since the re-unification of the two Germanies, more people had been in employment. His forecast for 1999: number of unemployed down by 200,000, also due to demographical factors: there will be more older workers finishing up, and less younger people to go to work.  </field>

<field name="text">There has been an incident in section B of Hesse's nuclear power-plant at Biblis. On Wednesday, operator RWE found radioactivity in a secondary circuit, according to the Environment Ministry at Wiesbaden. They thought that radioactive water had leaked from the reactor's core to the secondary circuit via the steam-generator. Radiation had kept rising, and that was why procedures for powering-up again after the revision, had been halted.  </field>

<field name="text">DaimlerChrysler AG has decided on a new remuneration system for their top-managers. As of today, salaries for the approximately 250 top-managers will consist of a fixed base-salary (25%) and a portion depending on how well the company had been doing (75%). The latter can be in bonus-payments or share-options. This would level the salaries between American (Chrysler) and German (Daimler) managers.  </field></doc></add>

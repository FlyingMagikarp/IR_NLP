<field name="text">The committees of the new SWF state radio- and television-network started work today, voting for Mr Hans Lambert as first president. There will be more voting until 13 March, though not many outsiders will be competing against incumbents of the two organisations being amalgamated. Previously state premiers Teufel and Beck, of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate respectively, had stated that the new SWF would be seen as a chance to reform the association of state radio- and television-networks (ARD).  </field>

<field name="text">A hunger-strike staged by 64 Kurds in Augsburg lasted a mere three hours: the men wanted to demonstrate against what they considered slow processing of their applications for asylum. After the district council had proposed to assist them they stopped. To drive the message home, two Kurds literally sealed their lips by stitching them together. Police and representatives of the district council as well as of the city of Augsburg were involved in the after-hours negotiations. The Kurds returned to their quarters at about 5 o'clock in the morning when they were offered to put pen to paper and sign a petition. The two Kurds who had sealed their lips had to be treated at a hospital.  </field>

<field name="text">The Association for Mentally Retarded Persons intends to collect signatures against a ruling by a Cologne court. The judge had ordered a group of them to stay out of their garden at certain times, as a neighbour, who had claimed that the retarded persons' voices were putting too much of a strain on him, had won in court. The Association wants a law banning discrimination against retarded people.  </field>

<field name="text">Schweinfurt police impounded an automatic flash, triggered by a speed-camera's flash and resulting in the car's number-plate becoming unreadable. Apparently the manufacturers are loacated in the district, though the public prosecutor is not giving away any details. Spare-part suppliers and the general public had received chain-letters selling the product called Contraflash. Investigators take it that this would breach consumer legislation, as the suppliers had led them to believe that using Contraflash was not against the law. This would be a case for the Business Courts.  </field>

<field name="text">Today the so-called Knock-out drops trial at the Nuremberg/Fuerth Regional Court entered round two. From 1991 to 1995 two men from Croatia had drugged and robbed more than 50 men; five of them died from the effects of the drugs. Today defence counsel started pleading. Senior prosecutor Heidner previously had asked for two life-sentences, and also wanted both closely investigated as to any eventual mitigating circumstances.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">All across Germany, more than 100,000 people have taken part in the annual May rallies on today's Labor Day, protesting against unemployment and the deterioration of the welfare state.  The events were held under the motto of securing the welfare state, creating jobs, and implementing social justice.  DGB [National Trade Union Federation] chairman Mr.  Schulte accused the government and corporations of pursuing a policy that accelerates the loss of jobs.  At the same time, he referred to the options of reducing overtime hours and increasing part time work.  In an interview on Deutschlandfunk radio, Mr. Schulte added that the key to increased employment lies in the hands of private and public employers. In view of the economic growth, the preconditions for new jobs have never been more favorable.  People are more willing to accept shorter hours or part time employment for a limited period of time, the DGB chairman said. In addition, he said he was willing to negotiate an agreement with the employer association to establish a framework for the reduction of overtime work.  In Leipzig, the chairman of IG Metall, Mr. Zwickel, underscored his call for a 32-hour working week.  The head of DAG [National Union of Employees], Mr. Issen, demanded a change of power in Bonn.  </field>

<field name="text">Following the ban on a NPD [Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschland, National Democratic Party of Germany, right wing party] rally in Leipzig, the dreaded gathering of right-wing extremists failed to materialize. Nevertheless, in clashes between right and left-wing extremists, more than 100 people were taken into custody.  Several Neo-Nazis went on the rampage in Hannoverschmuenden near Kassel. In Berlin, a massive police presence prevented acts of vandalism at a demonstration held by more than 6,000 extreme leftists.  In the Prenzlauer Berg district, a street fight ensued.  </field>

<field name="text">The presidency of the European Union, currently held by The Netherlands, has called on member countries to postpone the already agreed-upon return of their diplomats to Iran.  Iran must not succeed in driving a wedge into the Union, it was said.  Previously Iran had confirmed that the German Ambassador to Teheran is not welcome there at the present time.  Foreign Minister Kinkel emphasized that the totally unreasonable reaction of Iran is apparently linked to the presidential election campaign currently under way in the country.  </field>

<field name="text">The number of ethnic Germans immigrating to the Federal Republic continues to decline.  According to information released by the Interior Ministry in Bonn, almost 11,500 ethnic Germans moved to Germany in April, most of them from countries of the former Soviet Union.  One year ago the number stood at 13,280.  Since the beginning of the year, immigration of ethnic Germans has decreased by roughly 8,900 to 45,300, compared to the same period in 1996.  The decline is related to the mandatory German language test prior to emigration from the former USSR, the Interior Ministry explained.  </field>

<field name="text">Government and opposition parties fought vigorously over the reform of the so-called 630-marks jobs. There are plans to do away with tax-exemptions and charge contributions to the public social-security system instead. Deputy leader of the opposition parliamentary group Kuehs called that a cop-out, government trying to become richer by taking money out of peoples' pockets for social-security. Family Minister Christine Bergmann, however, defended the proposal: "I think that women will have a better chance of getting decent part-time, or even full-time work, in the medium run, because the new system makes casual work less attractive for employers. We can't just sit on the fence and moan about dwindling numbers of people paying into the system, when at the same time millions are not paying their share by using a perfectly legal loophole. Our proposals will put a stop to that, and that's why I am glad we've finally got this draft law."  </field>

<field name="text">Following a ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) about tax-rebates for families, government intends to come up with a draft law until this summer. During question-andanswer time at parliament, SPD financial expert Ms Matthaeus-Mayer said that married couples with children as well as sole-parents would be winning. It is still moot how government will pay for that. The Greens are thinking about scrapping the special tax-privilege for married couples, to cover the expected shortfall. Members of the opposition parties, however, said that this could be against the constitution  </field>

<field name="text">There was nor progress in the metal-workers' award-negotiations. Bavaria postponed negotiations after 2 hours of talks, and more of the same happened in Hesse, Rhine-land/Palatinate and Saar. The unions refused to accept the employers' offer to raise salaries and wages by 2%. The employers had also offered a one-off payment of .5%, depending on the companies' economic situation. Head of the union Zwickel said that they would not allow a two-class system for staff. They asked for a (general) 6.5% rise,  </field>

<field name="text">Today the late actor Guenther Strack was put to rest in Franconia's Muenchsteinach. Approximately 300 people followed the hearse to the St Nikolaus Cathedral, with some 2,000 spectators lining the streets. Loudspeakers made sure sermon and eulogy could be heard outside the church. Hesses's State Premier Eichel, a close friend of the family, was shaken when he said: "His art has touched us all, he was one of the actors who will still be there long after they've gone."  </field>

<field name="text">Bavarian police acted outside the law during the visit of China's head of state Xiang-Tse-Min in 1995. According to a ruling by the Munich Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht), police had had no right to interfere with a demonstration organised by Amnesty International (who also had applied for and obtained a permit for it). Police had deployed a brass-band and a bus in a way that made the demonstration useless. When the convoy turned 'round the corner, they drove the bus right in front of the demonstrators, and that's when the brass-band started playing as well, making sure the demonstrators were neither seen nor heard. At the time, some 50 demonstrators had wanted to protest against human rights violations in China using banners.  </field>

<field name="text">Only few Germans are shopping on the Internet, according to a study by Bielefeld's market research institute EMNID and Stuttgart's Frauenhofer Institut. Last year only 1% of all Germans bought something on the Internet, occasionally, whereas 4% tried it out once and 95% didn't even want to try. Reasons: loading the relevant brochures, also called WWW-pages, onto their computers takes very long, and the pages are not well organised. And apart from that, telephone calls are expensive (all calls are metered), plus many people are afraid of putting confidential data on the Internet, such as their credit-card numbers  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text"> Federal Economics Minister Rexrodt expects that wages in East Germany will permanently fall short of West German levels.  In his state of the union address on the occasion of the anniversary of German Unification, Rexrodt said before the Bundestag that employers can only pay wages which are backed by revenue.  Therefore, the flexibility for undifferentiated adjustments to West German levels is at an end.  The unification process has turned out to be more difficult than anticipated in 1990.  Nevertheless, the "emergency operation German Unification" has gone surprisingly well.  The SPD accused the government of euphemizing the situation.  East Germany is again losing ground compared to West Germany, the SPD representative Mr. Schwanitz said. While the government continued talking about a blooming land, the catch-up of the East to the West has almost ceased to exist, he concluded.  </field>

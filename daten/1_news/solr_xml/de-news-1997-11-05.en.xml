<field name="text">The new chairman of the German Protestant Church, Kock (sp?) has criticized the measures heretofore undertaken to battle unemployment. He said it was too easy to put people off with the declared intention to try to halve the number of unemployed by the year 2000. He also said that a solution to this problem could only be reached if every part of the society was functioning and mobilized. Kock added that the church would therefore not simply speak comforting words, but rather would stick its finger in the open wounds. He continued that even the current proviso, that any measure should only be undertaken if it is reasonably sure to meet with some success, deserves to be questioned at this point. Kock, the leader of the church for the Rhineland area, was named chairman of the German Protestant Church today, replacing the retiring Bishop Engelhard (sp?).  </field>

<field name="text">Unemployment levels in Germany remain high. Jagoda, the president of the Federal Labour Office, announced today that there were 4.29 million unemployed people in Germany in October. That figure is actually down by 17,800 from the previous month, but up by 423,000 over a year ago. In the East, the numbers translate to a rate of 18.2 percent, almost double that in the West. Jagoda did speak of a slight stabilization in the labour market, but added that a sustained recovery was not to be expected within the next year. Government spokesman Haussmann, on the other hand, indicated that he was convinced that 1998 would see a significant turn-around.  </field>

<field name="text">Federal President Herzog's call for basic reforms to the education system has been met with mixed responses. His speech was largely approved of by the parties, opposed by the Education Ministers' Conference. The president of the Conference, Wernstedt (sp?), said that Herzog's speech advocated many projects which are already in progress. But Baden-Wuerttemberg's Sciences Minister von Trotha said that institutions of higher learning did indeed need some modernization; the changes to the Higher Education Law recently passed were not nearly sufficient. Herzog today called for a national debate on the future of the education system. He is calling form more practical application, shorter terms of study, and more competition.  </field>

<field name="text">The EU Commission has threatened the media companies Bertelsmann, and Kirch, as well as the Telekom with heavy fines. Competition Commissioner van Miert (sp?) warned the companies today against proceeding with their digital television joint-venture without waiting first for EU approval. The Commission will investigate whether the companies have already implemented part of a merger without registering it in Brussels. If they have, they could face fines of up to 10 percent of their yearly incomes. The Commission has the right to examine company mergers, to see if they could lead to the misuse of a dominant market position.  </field>

<field name="text">Scientists from Switzerland and Germany have experienced a break-through in their research into mad cow disease and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. According to a report in the British science magazine "Nature", they have developed an antibody to test directly for diseased prions. The development will allow, for the first time, testing on living organisms. The antibody is expected to be significant in the development of future therapies for prion diseases. Intensive efforts to develop such an antibody have been underway all over the world since the early 1980s, but until now the presence of the mutated protein which plays a role in mad cow disease and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease could only be detected indirectly.  </field>

<field name="text">Those forced into labour in Germany under the Nazis are not entitled to further recompense. The Regional Court in Bonn made the precedent-setting ruling today. The lawyer for the plaintiff, Klaus von Muenchhausen (sp?) called the decision the worst possible solution, and filed an appeal. The federal government and the finance ministry welcomed the ruling. According to the court, additional compensation is only possible if an individual has not yet received any compensation under the Federal Compensation Law, either in the form of lump-sum or pension payments. The judges granted a woman from Poland over DM 15,000 in compensation, because she could not make good her claims in time.  </field>

<field name="text">The German Government will not admit any compensation being paid for quitting nuclear energy. Chancellor Schroeder said today "As far as I know these contracts, there is no reason to consider any compensation demands of French companies or the French State. We will not let it come to any compensation. This is part of the coalition contracts and will be strictly obeyed." The Frenchmen still demand a compensation in the case that German nuclear waste will not be reprocessed in France anymore. The Britons argue the same way.  </field>

<field name="text">According to EU-circles, an earlier introduction of the Euro-cash is possible. Legally the 11 countries of the Euro-zone have to decide this unanimously on the basis of a proposal of the EU-commission. In a few months, a change of the schedule could be successful with great political will. So far the introduction of the Euro-cash is scheduled for January 2002. Several European Financial Ministers expressed their opinion for an earlier introduction. The president of the EU-commission, Santer, basically welcomed this. But some technical questions still have to be settled.  </field>

<field name="text">After the health insurance reform, the mineral baths and health resorts in Baden-Wuerttemberg still have to struggle for survival. This said the Minister of Economics, Doering, on the tourist fair CMT in Stuttgart. Instead of a rising number of overnight stays, there might happen additional closures of hospitals and the loss of jobs. "We are on the way of recovery, but it is still a long way to go that we can relax in our armchair and call this crisis overcome. That means, we do not only have to wait for patients on prescription, but also for private patients." For this year, Doering announced a support programme for health resorts.  </field>

<field name="text">The tax-reform did not happen, and yesterday's and today's reactions show clearly how far the two sides were - and still are - apart. Mr Schaeuble, of the CDU/CSU, puts on a brave and optimistic face: he thinks the reforms will happen, in 2000 at the latest, according to a newspaper-interview. Why? The SPD opposition will not want to be seen to be driving up unemployment by throwing spanners in the works or by being uncooperative.  Mr Schaeuble also critised Lower Saxony's premier Schroeder (SPD). He claimed that Mr Schroeder had just jumped ship when the going got rough, and kept talking about things without doing something. Mr Lafontaine, SPD, wanted to put a stop to the tax-reforms and call for early federal elections. This would be what the vast majority of the population would prefer, too. It would be a disgrace to give millionaires large tax-breaks and at the same time rip off pensioners, commuters and shift-workers.  </field>

<field name="text">Head of metal and engineering union IG Metall Klaus Zwickel wants to press for a collcetive agreement on part-time retirement by strike if necessary. If the employers are not to prepared to negotiate a solution the union would have a strike ballot in September in the North Wuerttemberg/North Baden region, Zwickel said in Frankfurt on Main. Without an additional collective agreement the law on part-time retirement was likely to become a flop. In North Wuerttemberg/North Baden collective bargaining talks have been suspended on June 25 without result. Employers had demanded that companies could offer part-time retirement voluntarily while IG Metall is striving for a obligatory part-time retirement.  </field>

<field name="text">The controversial sect "Colonia Dignidad", founded and run by German-born Paul Schaefer, is getting more and more into hot water. In order to escape arrest by the police in Chile, Mr Schaefer had gone into hiding a while ago, and his deputy plus some members now followed suit, crossing the border into Argentina. Last night Mr Hartmut Hopp, the second-in-charge and the sect's so-called Foreign Minister, fled to Argentina, accompanied by his wife, Ms Dorothea Withan, and his adopted son Michael as well as a servant and a man called Friedhelm Zeitner. Mr Hopp was to be arrested today for fraud. Allegedly he had taken his adopted son from an illiterate mother, pretending he was very ill and required an urgent operation. The mother was tricked into signing both the consent-form (for her son's operation) and adoption-papers. The child subsequently had been sexually violated and later made to marry Dorothea Withan (who was 15 years older than the bride-groom). Mr Hopp currently resides in Mendoza in the Argentinian Andes.  </field>

<field name="text">Today the person allegedly trying to hold supermarket-chain Tengelmann to ransom was arrested. The 30-year old unemployed man admitted to his wrong-doing. He had asked for 5 million marks, threatening to poison food in the Tengelmann supermarkets. He had asked for (and got) several credit-cards which he used to withdraw a couple of thousand marks from automatic teller-machines before he was arrested. Apparently he was in debt up to the hilt.  </field>

<field name="text">There is conflict within the ranks of the CDU/CSU regarding who should be chosen as a successor to Helmut Kohl. Mr. Oettinger, the deputy parliamentary leader of the CSU, said to the "Deutschlandfunk" radio station that reservations voiced by the CSU regarding choosing Wolfgang Schaeuble, the parliamentary leader of the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag, were not called for and harmed the party's chances of winning the elections. He said that the CSU's  policies were perhaps good for their image, but harmful to their sister party, the CDU. He continued that no-one doubted that after Mr. Kohl, Mr. Schaeuble had the most authority in the Union. Mr. Friedrich, the deputy leader of the CSU, has also said in a newspaper interview that his party would make a significant contribution in choosing a successor for Mr. Kohl and that the CSU also had suitable people for being chosen as the party's candidate for Chancellor.  </field>

<field name="text">Politicians of both the SPD and the CDU are supporting introducing a tax on profits from shares. Mr. Dressler, the SPD expert on welfare matters, said that it was unjust that those who were ill had to pay increased contributions towards the cost of the medicine while others did not have to pay taxes on the millions of marks of profit made from speculating in shares. A newspaper article in the "Bild am Sonntag" reported that Mr. Dressler is calling for a taxation of profits made both from speculating and in industry.  Geissler, the deputy parliamentary leader of the CDU/CSU, has supported the introduction of an international speculation tax, as, he said, the heated share markets were not healthy for the capitalist system. Mr. Geissler is a supporter of introducing international regulations for controlling financial markets according to a policy of socially responsible market systems.  </field>

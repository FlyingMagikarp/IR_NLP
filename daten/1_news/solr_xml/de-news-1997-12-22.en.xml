<field name="text">The chairman of the economic committee of the Bundestag warned against a labour battle in the eastern German steel industry. Ost said that while faced with a difficult economic situation in this region, the IG Metall (metal-workers' union) would cause damage to the region and its unemployed if it went forward with the strike. All parties involved would have to do their best to avoid this. The IG Metall local chairman for Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony, Duevel, emphasised the union's willingness to go on strike. On Deutschlandfunk radio he said that the issue was above all political. Because the amount was rather small, the employers obviously wanted to stop the process of adjustment to the western German level. In  an IG Metall ballot, about 78% of the members voted to go on strike in mid-January.  </field>

<field name="text">In Duesseldorf, leading politicians of the North Rhine-Westphalian Green Party discussed the conflict with the Social Democrats on the surface brown coal mining project Garzweiler 2. The joint coalition commission is scheduled to meet as a mediation instance. Last night, a final mediation attempt in the chancery of state ended without results.   Environmental minister Hoehn accused her Social Democratic colleague Clement, state minister of economics, of having passed a draft version of the plant regulations plan to Rhein Braun, which runs Garzweiler 2, not including the modifications planned by her ministry. According to the Green Party, the final version of this plan is not yet available to the minister of the environment. The dispute between Hoehn and Clement mainly concerns the question whether the plant regulation plan contains solutions for all legal problems concerning water quality. According to the Greens, the Social Democrats deny that the minister of the environment is fully responsible. Clement has not yet answered the accusations. At a special party meeting on January 17, the Greens plan to decide if they will remain in the coalition.  </field>

<field name="text">In the morning representatives of the environmental organisation Greenpeace met Mr. Beckmeyer, port senator of Bremen, to discuss the planned transport of nuclear waste to Scotland. According to a correspondent of Deutschlandfunk radio, Beckmeyer agreed not to have future transports go through Bremerhaven, but the plutonium from Hanau now waiting in the harbour would be shipped as planned. Greenpeace representatives had rejected this plan. Since this morning members of the organisation have been blocking the ferry Arneb. Seven environmental activists chained themselves to the container ship to stop the transport. A speaker of Greenpeace said that the block would continue. The activists had called on the port senator to stop transports of nuclear waste via Bremerhaven immediately. According to Greenpeace the captain of the Arneb had tried to open the back door from inside just before the negotiations. At the moment the Bremerhaven coast guard is on board of the Arneb to de-escalate the tense situation.  </field>

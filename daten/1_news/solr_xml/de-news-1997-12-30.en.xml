<field name="text">After Federal Minister for the Families Claudia Nolte's call to tighten up the abortion lesgislation (the so-called article 218), two further members of parliament of the CDU/CSU faction have voiced their support of her proposal. In the BILD tabloid, Mr Singhammer (MP, CSU) has demanded a shortening of the period where abortions are possible. Mr Hueppe (MP, CDU) suggested to restrict the number of medical indications sanctioning an abortion. Earlier, the Federal Minister of Justice, Mr Schmidt-Jortzig, has spoken against changing the abortion legislation. The now valid legislation had been the result of long discussions in parliament and therefore should not be changed without need. FDP secretary-general Guide Westerwelle called on Ms Nolte not to question the compromise that had been so hard to find. Other FDP politician as well as spokesperson of the SPD and the Greens rejected Ms Nolte's proposal, too. In support of her proposal, Ms Nolte had argued that the now valid abortion legislation had to be questioned since the number of abortions had not decreased since its introduction in 1994. The "pro familia" organisation countered the minister's reasoning by pointing out that the real number of abortion did not increase [since 1994]. Since the legislation came into effect, just the number of unknown abortions has decreased, because most abortions have been reported since then.  </field>

<field name="text">FDP secretary-general Guido Westerwelle has strongly criticised the left-liberal "Freiburg circle" within the party. In his criticism he expressly included leading FDP politicians. The secretary-general urged these politicians, who he did not name, to consider the consequences of such public statements. The FDP needed close ranks and was not able to support the egoism of some members who just want to distiguish themselves, Mr Westerwelle added. Member of the FDP Executive Board Sabine Leuthaeuser-Schnarrenberger had voiced her doubts in the Frankfurt Allgemeine newspaper whether the heads of the party are up to their job.  </field>

<field name="text">Hardly two weeks before the announced strike in the East-German metal sector the first company has given in to the demands of the unions. Preussag Stahl AG has agreed to pay the 530 employees of its Ilsenburg (Saxony-Anhalt) rolling mill the same wages as in West-Germany. The IG Metall union described Preussag's decision as a sign of reason and called on the other East-German companies in the metal sector to follow Preussag's step. The sector's employers' association, however, said the situation of the Preussag plant was different compared to other steel producing companies in East-Germany. For the productivity in the Ilsenburg plant has reached the level of comparable plants in West-Germany and since it was one of two East-German plants in the sector that was profitable.  </field>

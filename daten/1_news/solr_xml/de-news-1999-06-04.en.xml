<field name="text">Following the backing of the Kosovo peace-resolution by the Yugoslavian government, NATO will take first steps to it realisation as early as Saturday. NATO-general Jackson will meet Yugoslavian generals at the Kosovo border. They will talk about the nitty-gritty of troop-withdrawals, which according to the resolution have to be finished within seven days. Germany supposedly will send more armed forces to join the planned Kosovo peace-corps than originally planned. According to secretary Wichert, there could be some 1000 additional soldiers.  </field>

<field name="text">NATO stopped air-raids on Belgrade and Serbian metropolitan centres; they had not been targets for Friday night's sorties, according to NATO sources. Attacks against Serbian troops, however, had not slowed down. And apart from that, a headquarter of the special police and an airport had been bombed. France's head of state Chirac declared that from now on NATO would confine air-raids to military targets. Meanwhile the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) declared that Serbian armed forces had started a new offensive in the Kosovo.  </field>

<field name="text">As planned, duty-free shopping within the EU will cease at the end of this month. During the EU-summit meeting, a majority had been for an extension of the current system, but this was vetoed by the Netherlands and Denmark. The heads of state also agreed on a resolution to reduce unemployment. Main issues of the agreement are co-ordination of economic policies and a joint strategy to improve labour markets and the base for innovation.  </field>

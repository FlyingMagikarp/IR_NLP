<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder has reached a breakthrough in the struggle to rescue the construction company Holzmann. After a meeting with the Chancellor, the banks representing Holzmann's creditors said they were ready to accept a revised restructuring plan for the giant construction firm. Schroeder said that jobs had been protected to the greatest extent possible, but the banks have stretched themselves to the limit of what is economically practicable. Schroeder appealed to Holzmann's competitors to show fairness and not take advantage of the company's current state of weakness. According to Schroeder, the federal government will contribute 250 million DM to Holzmann's reorganization. This includes a capital funds loan of 150 million DM, and an guarantee of a further 100 million DM. Holzmann AG has announced that its previous registration of bankruptcy will be withdrawn on Thursday.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federation of German Industry (BDI) warned against political interference in commercial markets. The negative reaction of politicians to the planned takeover of the German firm Mannesmann by the British communications giant Vodafone is disturbing, said Executive Director von Wartenberg. Only the owners should have any say in the decision. In the case of Holzmann, von Wartenberg said he was concerned that politics could lead to a situation that would end up being expensive for taxpayers. It would be tragic if economic judgements wound up being compensated for by taxpayer money.  </field>

<field name="text">NATO concedes that it is possible that 3,000 Kosovo Albanians have been killed by Serb forces within the last three weeks.  These estimates are supported by eye witness reports.  Air surveillance photographs also seem to show a growing number of mass graves in Kosovo.  The stream of refugees moving into neighboring countries continues unabated.  Since yesterday, Serb forces have driven more than 25,000 people from Kosovo to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported.  Based on the figures published by the UNHCR in recent days, only some 375,000 ethnic Albanians remain in Kosovo.  The large refugee camps in neighboring countries are already hopelessly overloaded.  Smaller camps are now needed, but those have not yet been set up.  The UN is considering evacuating more Kosovo refugees to other countries due to Macedonia's refusal to establish further refugee camps.  The USA and Canada, for example, have offered to accept 30,000 refugees, but have not been taken up on that offer.  Albania has requested further financial assistance.  Aid from the European Union, already approved, is no longer sufficient because the number of refugees to receive assistance was underestimated, a spokesperson of the Albanian government said.  In yesterday's raids of Yugoslav ground troops, NATO destroyed seven tanks, according to NATO headquarters.  According to Commander-in-Chief Clark, the alliance will step up its attacks on targets in Yugoslavia.  Clark said that President Milosevic must give in, otherwise NATO would destroy everything that is important to him.  </field>

<field name="text">The former EU Balkan negotiator, Mr. Bildt of Sweden, considers the air strikes against Yugoslavia a failure.  The NATO attacks have increased human suffering. Ground troops should be deployed now, Mr. Bildt said in an interview with the news magazine "Focus."  The Bosnia specialist of the federal government, Mr. Koschnik, told "Bild am Sonntag" that the likelihood for ground troop deployment rises the longer the war drags on. Foreign Minister Fischer, however, said in an interview with "Der Spiegel" that the NATO strategy without ground troops is the correct one. Yugoslav President Milosevic will lose in the end, he added.  </field>

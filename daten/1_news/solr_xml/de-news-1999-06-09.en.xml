<field name="text">Legal proceedings may be taken against the Belgian government on account of the dioxin scandal. According to a spokesperson for the EU Commission in Brussels, the country should have taken all suspected products off the market, but this was apparently not done. Furthermore, Belgium violated conditions imposed by the EU. The European Commission had instructed the Belgium government to remove all food products from circulation which contained ingredients suspected of being produced on dioxin-contaminated farms. For the protection of consumers, the Ministry of Health in Bonn issued appropriate emergency regulations today at noon. Department Head Funke called the official information coming from Belgium "absurd". Meanwhile in Baden-Wuerttemberg, a slightly increased level of dioxin was detected in eggs from Belgium.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal cabinet in Bonn postponed a decision regarding financial aid for two nuclear power plants in the Ukraine. The decision will be taken next week at the earliest, pending parliamentary consultations. The SPD and Greens have introduced a joint measure on this topic in the Bundestag. According to the measure, Germany will only take part in the financing if the Ukraine builds gas-fired power plants instead of nuclear ones. Behind the controversy stands the alleged statement from Chancellor Schroeder that he supports the project regardless. According to sources in Bonn, despite his own misgivings, Schroeder feels bound by a 1995 treaty between the G7 nations and the Ukraine.  </field>

<field name="text">The parliament of the European Union has accused the EU Commission of failure in dealing with the cattle pest BSE ("mad cow disease"). This is the conclusion of a preliminary report by the EU parliament's BSE inquiry commission. The report says the EU Commission has taken human health less seriously than the potential breakdown of the beef market. The dangers of the cattle pest have been downplayed. The Commission has not used all its powers to check on abattoirs in Great Britain. The parliamentary report will be officially presented in February.  </field>

<field name="text">The Liberal FDP wants to press for reforms in various areas this year. This was announced by high-ranking politicians at the party's Epiphany [6 January] congress in Stuttgart. The reforms concern taxes, and the education, pensions, and welfare system. Party leader Wolfgang Gerhardt repeated that his party wants to abolish the solidarity surcharge by the year 2000. He added the abolishment did not mean a reduction of solidarity with the new states but the surcharge must not turn into a continuous tax with a negative image for the German re-unification.  </field>

<field name="text">Social Democrats (SPD) have asked the European Union to take economic sanctions against Belgrade. Milosevic's government has to be isolated, said SPD foreign affairs spokes-person Karsten Voigt today in Bonn. Additionally, the German government should, within the European Union, speak up for the recognition of the results in the Serbian local elections.  Earlier, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had again admonished the Serbian leadership to acknowledge the election victories of the opposition alliance Sajetno (sp?). At the traditional Epiphany meeting of the Liberal Party (FDP) in Stuttgart, Mr Kinkel said those who ignore the vote of the people will not find the way to Europe.  </field>

<field name="text">Property tycoon Juergen Schneider faces up to 15 years of imprisonment for the biggest bankruptcy ever in Germany's property sector. In the bill of indictment published today, the Public Prosecutor's Office charges Schneider with fraud, credit fraud, bankruptcy and forgery of documents. The trial against him, his wife and two other defendants will not begin until summer.  The Public Prosecutor's Office only looked into a small part of Schneider's deals. Those investigated, though, are representative of all the frauds committed by the estate agent, said Public Prosecutor Dieter Heike (sp?). Mr Schneider is charged with five cases of fraud and one case of fraudulent bankruptcy with a total value of Dm650 million. The banks seem to be out of the woods meanwhile - the investigators did not find any leads to any participation of the banks in the frauds. They were able to show that the banks made mistakes, but stupidity in itself is not punishable.  Mr and Mrs Schneider went to earth on Easter 1994 and were tracked down in Miami, Florida, after a thirteen month search. Juergen Schneider initiated the biggest bankruptcy in the property sector in post-war Germany. When his empire went bust, his debts totaled more than six billion marks.  </field>

<field name="text">Due to the continuing cold, house and apartment owners must wait up to one week for heating fuel deliveries. The holidays and intense cold have caused a high demand for fuel. Mineral oil companies think fuel prices could increase because many rivers are frozen and the fuel has to be transported by train or trucks which would force prices up.  </field>

<field name="text">German President Roman Herzog asked both patients and physicians to be more economic to save the health services. At the opening of the 100. Annual Meeting of Physicians Herzog said in his speech that some health service providers take as much from the health insurers as possible. Similarly, patients should not act as if medical treatment and medicaments were free goods. Herzog said public health insurance is for the medically necessary and not for the fulfilment of sociopolitical wishes. President of the Chamber of Physicians Mr. Vilmar underlined that, in future, public health insurances would only be able to finance basic services. Vilmar said on ARD television anything beyond the basics, e.g. maternity preparation and vaccinations for foreign countries, had to be cancelled. Till Saturday, the 250 delegates will discuss mainly social and health policy issues.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Constitutional Court has today considered the Bavarian separate path regarding abortions. The Bavarian so-called pregnancy support complementary law stipulates that a medical practice must not gain more than 25% of its income from abortions. The law also prescribes a special licence for physicians to execute abortions. The law is to become effective on July 1. Two Bavarian physicians have challenged the law because it affects the free execution of their profession. The two men conduct about 80% of all outpatient abortions in Bavaria. The State of Bavaria on the other side points out that abortions are illegal according to a finding by a federal court. The ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court is expected in two weeks. Meanwhile, Bavaria has suggested the two physicians a temporary solution by allowing them to continue their practice beyond June 30. Bavaria made the concession after the court showed concerns that medical services may not be fully available to Bavarian women.  </field>

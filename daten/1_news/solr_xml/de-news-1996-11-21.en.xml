<field name="text">Chancellor Kohl has entered into the conflict which has arisen from Iranian murder threats against German prosecutors, in connections with the Mykonos trial of Berlin.  In a letter to the Iranian President, Mr. Rafsanjani, Kohl expressed his concerns about the latest political development which has the potential to jeopardize the long-standing friendly relations between both countries.  Kohl advocated avoiding further escalation.  At the same time, he asked Rafsanjani to prevent a further aggravation of the situation in Iran. The Chancellor pointed out that the Mykonos trial is not of a political nature.  He said German jurisprudence is independent and German courts sort out cases exhaustively.  Representatives of both countries have continued their effort today of defusing current tensions.  Spokesman of the Government, Mr. Hausmann, underscored in Bonn that there is no reason of adopting a different attitude toward Teheran.  Despite the latest threats, Germany wants to stick to the "policy of critical dialog".  Hausmann emphasized, however, that Bonn will not bend under pressure or extortion.  The Iranian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Mousavian, commented on the latest anti-German protests in his country that one should not equate the public and published opinion with the official policy of Teheran.  </field>

<field name="text">On January 1, the premiums for the mandatory pension plan will increase from 19.2% to 20.3% of gross salaries.  This piece of legislation was passed by the Bundestag, and is now up for Bundesrat approval.  Labor Minister Bluem explained this increase demonstrates again the necessity to think about adjusting the pension plan to the new challenges.  The head of the SPD parliamentary group, Mr. Scharping, demanded a reduction of pension premiums as well as unemployment insurance by 2% each.  This would lower the overhead cost of employment, strengthen the purchasing power and could create up to 400,000 new jobs.  Scharping spoke at a meeting of the heads of the SPD parliamentary groups of the European and State parliaments.  </field>

<field name="text">Another round of discussions about the 1997 taxation laws has remained without results today.  During the consultations of a subgroup of the mediation committee of Bundestag and Bundesrat, the Coalition insisted that the tax on cash assets be completely abolished.  Counter to that, the SPD wants to keep that provision in place at least for personal assets.  An abolition of the tax would lower tax revenue for the states on the order of billions of DM.  The 1997 taxation law also includes an increase of the tax on property purchases from 2% to 3%.  Furthermore, modifications in the inheritance tax are planned. The group is to continue the negotiations next Thursday.  </field>

<field name="text">According to a report by the Berlin newspaper TAZ, the President of the Treuhandanstalt (THA) [privatization and restructuring agency], Ms. Breuel, and Minister President Seite of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania had already known about subsidy misappropriation at the Vulkan shipyards since the end of 1993.  TAZ refers to secret documents of the Federal Criminal Police. According to these, the former chairman of Vulkan, Mr. Timmermann, had informed THA and the state that subsidies for East German shipyards had been used for investments in West German, in violation of their original designation.  Up until now, the official line had been that the authorities had learned about the wheelings and dealings at Vulkan at too late a time for taking action.  In the afternoon, it was announced that a consortium under the leadership of Rhein-Metall of Dusseldorf has bought the Vulkan spin-off Atlas Elektronik.  Aside from Rhein-Metall, Badenwerk and British Aerospace are members of the consortium.  </field>

<field name="text">The department store KAUFHOF on Berlin's Alexanderplatz lost in court once again after trying to sell the complete range on Sundays. The Higher Administrative Court (Oberverwaltungsgericht) confirmed the Administrative Court's (Verwaltungsgericht) ruling, so offering goods without local context for sale as souvenirs after 4 p.m. on Saturdays or on Sundays, will be against the law. The store now will stay closed on Sundays. In the city of Halle, however, five shops are allowed to sell their entire range on Sundays, according to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht), whereas shops in Dessau have to stay closed on Sundays  </field>

<field name="text">Federal Justice Minister Daeubler-Gmelin vehemently warned cities and companies against breaking the law on shopping-hours. She said that laws that had been passed correctly, had to be adhered to. It would be unacceptable if lobby-groups thought that the law would not apply to them, and that also went for the public quite unashamedly cheering on the lawbreakers. Some 62% of the population of Germany was against Sunday trading, according to research institute 'dimap'.  </field>

<field name="text">Head of the CDU Schaeuble welcomed Mr Struck's latest initiative as common ground for agreements on the tax-reform. The top-rate would have to be less than 40%, so reaching an agreement on that basis should not take long, as he stated in an interview with a newspaper. He also mentioned that for years the SPD had kept the CDU from lowering the tax-rate to 39%. Mr Struck had pleaded for a radical tax-reform featuring 3 brackets only: 15, 25 and 35%. This had raised some party-colleagues' hackles.  </field>

<field name="text">40-year old camera-operator Olaf Ullmann from Frankfurt/Oder passed away. He died of yellow fever in Berlin's Virchow Hospital. A special laboratory for tropical diseases had checked his blood for several viri. Initially, yellow fever had been ruled out, as Mr Ullmann allegedly had been vaccinated against it.

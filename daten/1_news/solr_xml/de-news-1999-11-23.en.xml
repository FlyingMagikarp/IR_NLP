<field name="text">Chancellor Schroeder is now going to intervene directly in the endeavour to save the Holzmann company. After a meeting with the head of the company's factory committee, Mahneke, Schoreder said that it was a last attempt to save a company capable of rehabilitation. Schroeder cannot believe that there is no willingness even to talk about filling the financing gap of approximately 250 million DM. Schroeder considers the discussion about engaging the government in the issue premature. Meanwhile, the demonstration of the employees continued in Frankfurt. The Holzmann company applied for insolvency at the court this morning. In the afternoon the commercial bank in Frankfurt in particular was blocked, since it was this bank that wouldn't accept the rehabilitation plan for the Philipp-Holzmann company. Hessen and bayern have announced that they want to help the suppliers of Holzmann. Hessen, for example, is willing to grant lowered credit over a total amount of 25 million DM.  </field>

<field name="text">German parliament has begun the debate on the budget for the year 2000. Every year the result is awaited with eager anticipation. It also functions as a balance of the opposition with the work of the government. The minister of finance only actually saved 7 billion DM instead of 30 billion DM, is the renewed accusation of the opposition. In addition, higher gas and power prices due to ecology taxes added an extra burden, says CDU economist Dietrich Austermann. Before minister of finance Hans Echel himself stepped up to the lectern, SPD economist Hans-Georg Wagner defended the savings plan. The mounatinous debt has finally been reduced and a foundation has thus been laid for necessary reforms. Thereupon Hans Eichel defended his budget plan for the year 2000. According to his plan, the new debts will sink below 50 billion DN for the first time since 1992, and the Red-Green government will not be saving for savings' sake, but with the ultmiate goal of achieving a balanced budget on a medium-term. This is planned for 2006.  </field>

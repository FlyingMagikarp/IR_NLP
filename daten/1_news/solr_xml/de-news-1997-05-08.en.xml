<field name="text">President Herzog has been awarded the international "Karlspreis" of the city of Aachen in recognition of his contribution to the unification of Europe.  King Juan Carlos of Spain praised Mr. Herzog as an advocate of dialogue between the cultures.  He urged critics to drop reservations about an expansion of the European Union.  In his vote of thanks, Mr. Herzog, too, took up this point.  He said the process towards European unification must be kept in motion and be freed from periodically occuring stagnation.  At the present time, security interests, the protection of assets and fears of a reduction in the standard of living have displaced the willingness to take risks, the President added.  He cautioned against viewing the unification of Europe as a purely economic task.  Europe is more than just an economic market with a future joint currency.  The President called for a return to a culture of freedom as the spiritual foundation of Europe.  Mr. Herzog is the third German President to receive this award, besides Walter Scheel and Karl Carstens before him.  The prize of DM 5000 has been awarded since 1950 to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the unification of Europe.  </field>

<field name="text">The professional association for workers of the construction industry in Berlin and Brandenburg has rejected the agreement put forward by the arbitration committee.  According to the association, the ruling is unrealistic.  The employers and unions of the construction industry also appear to be dissatisfied with the outcome reached by their negotiators and the mediator, Mr. Geissler.  The union IG Bau and the employers are equally disappointed with the new regulations for sick-pay.  If the bargaining commission of employers and unions rejects the mediator's ruling within the next 14 days, there could still be strikes in the construction industry.  </field>

<field name="text">Tax payers have been saved some 20 billion Marks by the railway-reform, according to the chairman of Deutsche Bahn [German Rail], Mr. Birr.

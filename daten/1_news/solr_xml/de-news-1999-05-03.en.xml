<field name="text">Bavaria announced its opposition to the plan by Federal Interior Minister Schily to double the German quota of Kosovo refugees. Schily intends to come to an agreement with the federal states to accept an additional 10,000 refugees. "It would be wrong to reward the inactivity of other European countries by raising the German quota," Bavaria's Interior Minister Beckstein argued. But Schleswig-Holstein's Interior Minister Wienhold called the acceptance of additional refugees a very positive decision. This would give authorities greater flexibility, especially with respect to reuniting families. Only a few days ago, the interior ministers decided to accept only so-called serious cases beyond the 10,000 refugees who had already arrived in Germany. The subject will be discussed again tomorrow afternoon.  </field>

<field name="text">Secretary of the Chancellor's Office Hombach defended the revision of the 630-DM jobs, but he did not rule out changes. Hombach told the Cologne newspaper Express that the goal was to stop the abuse in this area that had been inherited from the Kohl government. However, steps should be taken to ensure that the necessary flexibility for companies and employees with respect to part-time work would be kept. A revision of nominally independent contract work ("Scheinselbstaendigkeit") was also overdue, Hombach added, since this area had also seen frequent abuse.  </field>

<field name="text">The federal government considers lowering the top income tax rate to 43%. The chairperson of the Finance Committee of the Bundestag (lower house of parliament), Scheel, gave this statement to the newspaper Stuttgarter Nachrichten. Initially, the politician from the Green Party stated that a tax rate of 48.5% by the year 2002 had been planned. But now, it would be necessary to consider the ruling by the Federal Finance Court which required a uniform taxation of commercial and private income. Presently, the top tax rate is 53% for private income and 47% for commercial income.  </field>

<field name="text">A few days after sister party CDU had settled on their election manifesto, Bavaria's CSU followed suit today. Now they'll have to match the two parties' strategies and make them fit under a common umbrella.  More debates like the one about the eco-tax are not to be expected. At the so-called small congress in Ingolstadt, however, the CSU was not only focussing on the upcoming federal elections, but also on the state elections - preceding the former by two weeks (on 13 September). And they really packed their agenda: apart from general speeches by head of the party Theo Waigel and premier Edmund Stoiber, there will be five more about "Germany and Bavaria - a winner". Many are on tenter-hooks about what Mr Peter Gauweiler, head of the Munich district of the CSU, will tell them. He allegedly backs anti-immigration policies claiming that Germany and Bavaria are no immigration-countries. General Secretary Bernhard Protzner: "Foreigners who already are permanent residents will have to fit in and become German citizens. If they've got rights, they'll have to do their bit, too. And somehow or other we'll have to decide what's going to happen to criminals who still are foreigners (yet permanent residents)."  Head of the state parliamentary group Alois Glueck was into long-range planning: he proposed a new social and citizen culture, boosting self-reliance and solidarity and thus relieving the social net of some of its burdens. Head of the party Waigel is expected to mainly lay into SPD and PDS parties.  </field>

<field name="text">Regardless of who wins the federal elections, austerity is to reign supreme. Why? According to the most recent tax-revenue projections, there will be a shortfall of 99 billion marks unitl 2001. SPD candidate Schroeder stated that if he would win he would axe some ministries. As early as last Wednesday he had reacted to the new figures and asked for an opening of the books, as the situation was more serious than Finance Minister Waigel had tried to make the general population believe. In an interview with the tabloid BILD, he declared that he would go for a lean government if he won. If you do have to save, you start at the top. And he also said that there would have to be a re-think as far as finance for the SPD's plans was concerned. If he became Chancellor he would not make a decision without asking first if this would create new jobs or not. Boosting the economy should be done differently, namely by raising wages above the rate of inflation. This would stimulate domestic demand. If business made good money, the workers should get their share, too, according to Mr Schroeder.  </field>

<field name="text">The SPD wants to lean on government asking for a special session of the environmental committee in parliament, after high radiation readings on nuclear waste containers (so-called Castor containers) were discovered recently. Environmental spokesperson Lennartz, of the parliamentary group of the SPD, doubted that environment minister Merkel had not known about the high readings previously. She would have to resign if she had not said the truth, according to Mr Lennartz.  Yesterday Ms Merkel had put a hold on all Castor-movements. She does not consider resigning over the matter though. Her spokesperson, Gertrud Saler, said that whatever could have been measured in Germany, had been measured  </field>

<field name="text">Germany's Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) heeded advice from Brussels, the EU headquarters, amending current rulings: comparative ads are now legal, provided comparisons are neither misleading nor derogatory/libellous to the competitor. And they also have to be about qualities that can be verified and are typical.  </field>

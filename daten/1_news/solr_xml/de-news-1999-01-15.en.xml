<field name="text">Government is planning to get out of nuclear power, and that is guaranteed to raise someone's hackles. The power generators thinks that changing the laws about nuclear power would cast a big shadow over the planned consensual talks at the end of January. Preussen-Elektra threatened to take government to court over the planned ban on reprocessing nuclear fuel-rods as of this year. According to CEO Haarig, technical and economical reasons as well as the law were against putting a stop to reprocessing as early as this year. At the same time, he warned against an excessive number of shipments of (reprocessed) nuclear material from France and Great Britain back to Germany  </field>

<field name="text">Government's nuclear power policy has caused some concern abroad, too. France and Britain may ask for billions of marks in damages, in case existing re-processing contracts are cancelled before time. Minister Trittin, however, said he could not see any lawful reasons for that, after having had talks with France. At the same time he guaranteed that Germany would take back their own nuclear waste, generated during re-processing at La Hague/France.  </field>

<field name="text">Award-talks for approximately 840,000 metal workers in the South-West of Germany have been postponed without having reached an agreement. The employers did not make an offer in round two, and that's why some 40,000 workers downed tools for a short while. Both sides agreed on new talks on 28 January, which happens to be when the ban on industrial action ('cooling-off period') runs out. Unions are asking for a 6.5% rise, for East and West Germany.  </field>

The unions once again accused them of fanning xenophobia, the hate of foreigners/things foreign. According to government, some 2 million foreigners are expected to take out German citizenship according to the (planned) new legislation.  </field>

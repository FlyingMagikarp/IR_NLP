<field name="text">The Federal Alliance of German Industry (BID) has warned against tax increases to fill in budgetary holes.  Only iron discipline would help in this matter, BDI President Henkel told the news agency ddp.  Mr. Henkel considers the sale of the Telekom stock which Federal Minister for Finances Weigel was considering, and the reevaluation of the gold reserves in the federal bank to be emergency surgical procedures which would not really cure the patient in the long run.  But, he stated, this would still be better than raising the new debt ceiling. The BDI president continued to plead for massive savings in the budget of Federal Labor Minister Bluem.  </field>

<field name="text"> The rising deficits in the federal budget continue to stimulate discussion.  During a newspaper interview the president of the Federal Institute for Economic Research located in Halle, Pohl, advocated raising the debt ceiling in order to balance the budget after loss of tax income.  Overdrawn cuts in expenditures would damage the health of the economy.  The labor wing of the Union rejects the raising of taxes to compensate for lower revenues.  The CDA-head, Mr. Eppelmann said Christian Democrat workers would only agree to raising taxes to finance payments not covered by insurance; such payments would lessen the burden on the social coffers.  The president of the Retailers' Alliance, Mr. Franzen, also warned against raising taxes.  He said that would be a catastrophe for retailers.  </field>

<field name="text">The debate over possible tax increases to cover budget shortfalls is getting more heated within the ruling coalition. FDP leader Gerhardt declared in an interview that his party could only agree to one more budget without tax hikes. Federal Finance Minister Waigel said at the same time that he could not completely rule out tax increases for the coming year. Waigel announced that he would submit a budget for 1998 that conformed to the constitution at the meeting of Sudeten Germans. The first source for income replacement must be further privatization and the removal of state tax subsidies. On the subject of tax hikes Waigel said specifically that they were the absolute last resort, and an undesireable one at that, as a source for more income.  </field>

<field name="text">In contrast to the Social Democrats, the German Workers' Council (DGB) is campaigning for a reduction in pension levels. Council leader Schulte told the Cologne paper "Sonntags Express" that this was a necessity for demographic reasons. Because of increased life expectancies, people require pensions for longer periods. At the same time there are fewer working contributors. Schulte also made clear that coalition plans for higher tax levels for old age care was a reasonable topic. It is not a taboo theme, as long as the normal pensioner is exempt. The DGB leader added that the negotiations between Federal Labor Minister Bluem, employers and unions must conclude with a pension agreement in the next four to six weeks.  </field>

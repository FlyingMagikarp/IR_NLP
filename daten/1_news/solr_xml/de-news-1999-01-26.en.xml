<field name="text">In the course of the first consensus meeting on nuclear policy, the federal government and nuclear power companies reached an agreement. Government will not enforce strict dates for putting an end to recycling and for a general atomic energy shutdown. Industry, on the other hand, declared their willingness to work out phasing-out schedules for every individual plant. Minister for ecology Trittin called this a "partial success". SPD and Green Party coalition leaders agreed to present the revised draft for the new law on nuclear power by late February or early March. The second consensus meeting is planned for early in March. After the consensus had been reached, foreign minister Fischer declared himself in agreement with ecology minister Trittin's course. In a Green party caucus meeting, Fischer said the fact that nuclear industry was willing to talk about a phase-out was a historic turnaround. He also said the overall aim of nuclear phase-out was more important than keping to the 100 day schedule for changing nuclear legislation.  </field>

<field name="text">The red-green coalition have reached a compromise in the ecolocy tax scrap. All manufacturing companies are to pay but 20% of the additional tax on electricity, fuel oil, and natural gas. Average consumers will have to pay a surtax of 2 pfennigs per kWh of electricity, 4 pfennigs for a litre of fuel oil, and 0,32 pfennigs for natural gas. The 6 pfennig surtax on automotive gasoline will have to be paid by everubody without distinction. The proceeds of this ecological tax will be used by the government to reduce retirement contributions. Companies where the eco-tax payments exceed retirement contribution savings will be reimbursed for the difference by the internal revenue office, said SPD vice-faction leader Ms. Matthaeus-Maier. She showed herself confident that on April 1st both the eco-tax and the retirement contribution reductions will come into force.  </field>

<field name="text">In the face of opposition protest actions, the union parties' petition action against dual citizenship for resident aliens was started. Both SPD and Greens accuse the CSU of waging a campaign against resident alien citizens. Ms. Schmidt, Bavaria's SPD chairwoman, said that the action tended to promote a division within society instead of integration. CSU faction leader Glueck countered that these accusations were a motley construction of vilification, slander , and defamation. For people living in Germany, a basic cultural background of a Christian/occidental character was essential; a multi-cultural society was not called for, he said. State premier Stoiber announced that the union parties had started the petition campaign in view of the fact that the majority popular opinion was not in accord with the federal government's opinion.  </field>

<field name="text">While the grace period is running out, no solution is in sight for the metal workers' contract dicussions. Another try to reach a consensus fell on its face in North Rhine-Westphalia, the largest metal workers' region. Representatives of union and employers abruptly terminated the fourth round of talks just one hour after it had begun, without establishing a new meeting date. Employers stood pat on their offer of a 2% wage increase and a one-time payment of .5% subject to earnings level. The union insists on a 6.5 wage increase and announced a series of warning strikes in North Rhine-Westphalia for next Monday. In other regions, warning strikes are meant to be called as early as next Friday.  </field>

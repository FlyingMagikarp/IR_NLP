<field name="text">According to newspaper reports, Federal Minister of Finance Waigel confirmed that, beginning in 1999, the value added tax is to be raised by two percent to 17 percent. To be sure, Mr. Waigel does not want to raise the lowered 7 percent rate which, among other items. applies to books, transportation and food items.  The Minister wants to apply the additional revenues to the cost of the major tax reform. The SPD has again refused the latter since it is incongruent with the economic situation.  </field>

<field name="text">The head politician of the PDS does not wish to be in the new party leadership.  Mr. Gysi has not allowed his name to be placed in nomination for the evening election of the PDS convention in Schwerin.  He stated that his being a member of the party leadership would not be decisive for the policies of the PDS.  The only important matter was replacing the Kohl government.  The focus of Saturday's discussion at the convention was mass unemployment.  Among other measures, the delegates called  for the shortening of work days with full compensation. On Friday, the PDS had decided that, in the future, it would give up its role as a pure opposition party.

<field name="text">The CDU wants to remain tough in drug policies.  The thrust of the SPD for future legalization of not only hash for private use  but also of so called hard drugs like heroine or cocaine has encountered harsh criticism among the Christian Democrats.  Party Secretary General Hinze told the KOELNER EXPRESS that the CDU would not yield a millimeter in the matter of drugs.  If the gate were to be opened even a crack, there would be such flooding with drugs that the gate could never again be closed, Hinze told the paper.  Experience in other countries bore out that the legalization of narcotics would lead to increased consumption, he stated.  In the view of the CDU politician, therapy must set a life free of drugs as its goal rather than a life with drugs.  The parliamentary CDU spokesperson for internal policies within the states, Mr. Zeitelmann, expressed the view that the SPD was "bereft of its senses" when it made this proposal. The deputy head of the police union, Mr. Steffenhagen, expressed his approval for what he called the "principle of opportunity" in prosecuting drug dependent persons.  According to Mr. Steffenhagen, the police would have to be enabled to decide whether to initiate prosecution on a case by case basis.  </field>

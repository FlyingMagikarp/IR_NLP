<field name="text">In the process on the biggest bankruptcy in the German real estate sector, property tycoon Juergen Schneider has been sentenced to six years and nine months in prison. The Frankfurt Regional Court found Mr Schneider guilty of serious fraud, credit fraud and of forgery of documents. Mr Schneider had cleverly and professionaly deceived the banks in order to obtain higher loans. The "hardly imaginable negligence and recklessness" of the banks when handing out loans to Mr Schneider had been taken to the favour of the defendant. The court determined a father complex as motive for Mr Schneiders action: he wanted to prove to his Prussianly-strict father that he could be succesful in the business world.  After the verdict had been pronounced, Mr Schneider has been released for the time being, since the arrest order against him had been revoked. The 2 1/2 year long arrest of Schneider during the investigations will be counted towards his prison sentence. It is still unclear when Mr Schneider will have to return to prison to serve the remaining part of the sentence. The Public Prosecutor's office filed a complained against the release of Mr Schneider at the Hessian Higher Regional Court.  When Mr Schneider's real estate imperium collapsed in April 1994, the property tycoon had accumulated debts of DM5.4bn at over 50 banks.  </field>

At the same time Mr Kohl promissed a thorough investigation of the latest right-extremist incidents within the Bundeswehr. The Chancellor said: "In no case we can tolerate that maniacs or idiots or ideologists try to establish themselves at places where they don't belong".  Mr Kohl thanked the German troops stationed in Bosnia for their duty and expressed his will to continue the presence of international troops in the area.

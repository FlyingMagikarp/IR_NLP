<field name="text">The merger of German Telecom and Telecom Italia is settled. German Telecom and Telecom Italia may publicly announce their merger tomorrow, in a press conference in London, according to reports from well-informed sources.  The German company will hold about 60% of the corporation. Last night both companies had declared they were looking at a possible merger. German Telecom stocks rose 3.17% in morning trading in response to the announcement. German Telecom is already the market leader in Europe, and combined with the Italians, the new telephone corporation will be worth about DM 400 billion, employing more than 300,000. According to the daily "Handelsblatt", the merger will be worked through a stock swap, a process first practiced by Daimler Chrysler in an international deal. This would mean that the raise in funding capital announced for June might remain untouched. The new stock issue seems to be destined for the acquisition of additional companies.  </field>

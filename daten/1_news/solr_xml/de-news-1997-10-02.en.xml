<field name="text">The coalition government intends to finance the projected 2 % reduction of the solidary surcharge on income tax from 7.5 to 5.5 % without any tax increases. During the debate in the lower house of parliament in Bonn Finance Minister Theo Waigel declared that the losses of revenue would be compensated by reducing the contributions to the Debt Redemption Fund. As an additional measure some real estate could be sold. The parliamentary party leaders of the FDP (Liberals) and CDU (Conservatives), Hermann Otto Solms and Wolfgang Schaeuble, termed this approach an "act of solidarity with the unemployed".The parliamentary party leader of the Social-Democrats, Rudolf Scharping, however, called the compromise an accounting trick and a victory of the FDP over integrity and common sense. The parliamentary party leader of the Green Party accused the coalition government of having abandoned the state's interests in favour of maintaining their power. Theo Waigel defended the reduced contributions to the repayment of the Debt Redemption Fund with the low interest rates. According to Waigel this has lead to higher capital repayments than originally projected. The current compromise sets out that the contributions for 1998 will be reduced by DM 5 billion. But the government still intends to repay the remaining DM 325 billion debts of the GDR/THA (privatization and restructuring agency) within the next 30 years. Originally, the solidary surcharge was introduced to repay those debts.  </field>

<field name="text">Defence Minister Volker Ruehe demanded that the new members of NATO should bear the costs of modernising their armed forces largely themselves. During a meeting with his 16 colleges in Maastricht Volker Ruehe stressed that the costs of the expansion have to be kept as low as possible. This view was opposed by Mr. Cohen, Ruehes American counterpart, who stressed that the costs of expansion were higher than the Europeans presently anticipated. Each member of the alliance would have to share the burden.  </field>

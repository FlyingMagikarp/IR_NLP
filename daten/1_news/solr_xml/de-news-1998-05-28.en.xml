<field name="text">More than 50 years after the end of WWII, the Bonn parliament decreed the blanket annulment of all illegitimate Nazi court sentences. The Union parties, FDP and SPD issued a law rehabilitating several hundreds of thousands of victims of the Nazi regime. By this law, all sentences based on political, military, racial, religious or personal conviction grounds are declared null and void. Forced sterilization is also declared unlawful. No indemnities are to be paid. During the discussion, several members voiced their discontent with the fact that this law is coming much too late for many of those concerned. Green Party and PDS abstained. The Greens criticized that the law did not clarify the situation of deserters and homosexuals, as these groups were not named expressly.  </field>

<field name="text">A countrywide uproar was caused by a decision of the Munich District Court in the action against Internet illegal porno. Computer specialists accuse the judges of having decided without any knowledge of technical facts. Fedral Minster for R D Ruettgers announced his intention to have a sharp look at the decision. The Munich judges handed down a suspended 2-year sentence to former Compuserve/Germany manager Felix Somm for not preventing Internet distribution of child and violent porno material. Even the prosecution was surprised, having pleaded for absolution on the grounds that in 1995 it had not been technically possible for Compuserve to filter the contents of all messages. The defense was outraged and horrified and announced their intent to appeal. It was said that the prosecution was also planning something along this line.  </field>

<field name="text">Germany's federal government will have to shell out about DM 1 billion in arrears on coal subsidies. The Federal Administrative Court in Berlin decided that the cutback in subsidies for coal used by electrical power suppliers in 1986 had not been correctly executed. The judges thereby agreed with several power companies who had asked for recalculation. The companies' argument was that they were forced to use expensive German coal, but the difference in cost had not been compensated in full. They had asked for a total of DM 3 billion in arrears.  </field>

<field name="text">PDS politician Gysi was unsuccessful, for the time being, with his appeal to the Federal Administrative Court against the accusation of having been a collaborator of STASI [the former East German secret police]. The court refused to accept his emergency appeal against the Bundestag's Immunity Committee. The court found that an immediate decision in order to prevent severe negative effects was uncalled for. The merits of the appeal are to be decided by end June. The parliamentary committee can now publish its findings which imply the official collaboration of Gysi with STASI was a proven fact. SPD have urged Gysi to face the political music.  </field>

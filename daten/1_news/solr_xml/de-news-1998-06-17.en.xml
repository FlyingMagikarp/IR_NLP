<field name="text">The federal government is interested in military action in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo only if the UN Security Council issues a mandate to that effect. Government spokesman Hauser said today in Bonn that the federal cabinet shares the legal assessment expressed by the German Foreign Office; the government welcomes the British initiative to strive for a UN mandate. Hauser added that the international community must not relax its pressure on Belgrade. The American government announced that its fighter aircraft and ships would remain on stand-by, as NATO could yet reach a swift decision to intervene. The American envoy to the Balkans, Gelbhardt, warned Yugoslavia against crossing the border into Albania in their pursuit of Kosovo separatists. Representatives of various parties of the European Parliament in Strasbourg criticized the results of negotiations between Yugoslavian President Milosevic and Russian President Yeltsin, calling the entire proceedings a sham.  </field>

<field name="text">SPD chancellery candidate Schroeder wants to help Poland in its bid for membership in the EU and NATO if his party wins the federal election this fall. The Social Democrats, in contrast to the Associations for Displaced Germans (Vertriebenenverbaende - in this case from what is now Polish territory, following World War II), would not place advance conditions on membership for Poland, as Schroeder said during a one-day visit in Warsaw. While there, Schroeder also met with the leader of the Polish Social Democratic Party, Miller. Schroeder assured Miller that there would be no change in the direction of Germany's foreign, European, and security policies if the SPD came to power in the fall.  </field>

<field name="text">On this, the 45th anniversary of the failed Popular Uprising in East Germany, members of the Bundestag warned against playing down the crimes of the old socialist dictatorship. In Bonn, Bundestag President Suessmuth emphasized that the Popular Uprising on June 17, 1953 was an early visible signal that the people of East Germany were not just going to accept being oppressed by the state. She added that the significance of June 17 must not be allowed to simply fade from public consciousness. Politicians from the CDU/CSU, as well as the SPD and the Greens, accused the successor to the old SED socialist party, the PDS (the Party of Democratic Socialism) of lacking a proper understanding of democracy. PDS leader, Bisky, apologized in the name of his party for their misdeeds of their predecessors. Presenting the final report of the commission investigating how best to deal with the consequences of the SED dictatorship, commission chairman Eppelmann (CDU) emphasized the cooperation between the various parties on the commission in accomplishing the work.  </field>

<field name="text">Premier Stolpe of Brandenburg has refused to step down. This in reaction to demands for his resignation by members of the CDU/CSU following a ruling by the Federal High Court. The judges in Karlsruhe rules yesterday that Stolpe may be designated a collaborator with the former East German secret police, the Stasi. According to Stolpe's lawyer, the Premier will likely challenge the ruling before the Federal Constitutional Court. The basis for the challenge will be that Stolpe never received the opportunity to refute the accusations against him.  </field>

<field name="text">Ford has reached an agreement with the Kiekert manufacturing company, allowing production to resume at the Ford factory in Cologne after an interruption of almost three days. The assembly lines - still since Monday, after Kiekert last week suspended deliveries to the factory, citing technical difficulties - are reported to be running at the present time. Ford suspects that the door-lock manufacturer was trying to obtain more favourable conditions for future contracts. The loss caused by the production stop is estimated at about 100 million DM.  </field>

<field name="text">Amnesty International has accused governments around the world of lacking will in protecting human rights. In presenting the organization's 1997 report, secretary-general for the German section of A.I. in Bonn, Deile, said that world governments paid far more attention to economic, military, and geopolitical interests. He said that, in contrast, human rights merely provided cheap material for Sunday speeches and lip service. The report denounces violations against human rights in 141 countries, and indicates that people were tortured or abused in 2 out of 3 countries in the world last year.  </field></doc></add>

<field name="text">CDU and FDP have expressed criticism of the new electoral platform draft presented by the Green Party, saying that the call for raising gasoline prices to DM 5 per litre was particularly unrealistic. FDP secretary general Guido Westerwelle called the foreign-policy demands a formulaic compromise in NATO policy. In its new version, the draft now rejects Germany's unilateral abandonment of the military security treaty. The Greens do maintain as a long-term goal the abolition of NATO, to be substituted by an all-European security alliance. In the area of social policies, the draft calls for the introduction of basic social security; instead of the current unemployment compensation and social welfare, the socially weak are to be paid DM 800 per month per person. This model is supposed to be funded through reintroduction of property tax, an energy tax, and a gradual increase of the mineral oil tax.  </field>

<field name="text">Two youths attacked and critically injured a schoolgirl in Wuppertal. A police spokesman called it the most brutal attack on record in that region; saying that the injuries were not life-threatening but the girl was still in shock. It was highly improbable that her testimony might be taken today. Two young men of about 17 years of age had ambushed the 15 year old girl in Wuppertal in the morning. They ordered her to undress. When she refused, they drenched her with alcohol and set fire to her. Then they pushed her down a slope and fled. Police are searching for the perpetrators but have had no success so far.  </field>

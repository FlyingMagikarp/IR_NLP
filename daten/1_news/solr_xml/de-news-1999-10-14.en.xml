<field name="text">DaimlerChrysler subsidiary DASA and the French company Aerospatiale Matra are joining forces to create Europe's leading air and space company. This was announced today by DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart. The new company will be called EADS (European Aeronautic Defense Space Company). With its 89,000 employees, it is expected to show returns of 21 billion Euro. Daimler's chief Juergen Schrempp spoke of a pioneering industrial contribution toward Europe's unity.  The merger is considered the decisive step in reorganizing the Airbus consortium, of which DASA and Aerospatiale are the largest owners. EADS will be headquartered in the Netherlands and is expected to begin work in the first half of 2000, after the appropriate agencies have approved the deal.  </field>

<field name="text">The Association of German Pension Insurance Companies is satisfied with the compromise forged by the federal government and the trade union IG Metall for retirement at age 60. The pension system will not be burdened by costs for financing early retirement, said Association Director Franz Ruland yesterday evening in ARD-Television. However, it was going to be difficult, he added, to predict how many positions would be re-filled. That would be a point for employers and unions to negotiate.  Labor Minister Walter Riester and IG Metall chief Klaus Zwickel had already agreed on a plan. To qualify for early retirement, a person must have been making contributions to the pension fund for 35 years. The cost of pension contributions would not increase to fund the early retirement scheme, rather "tariff funds" collected from employees and employers would be established. Zwickel plans to present the plan to the Labor Alliance ("Buendnis fuer Arbeit"). Employers have already rejected the venture.  The Federal Pension Plan Agency for Salaried Employees (BfA) estimated that a total of 850,000 working women and men born between 1937 and 1944 could take advantage of early retirement.  </field>

<field name="text">A deposit in the millions made by a former GDR judge into a Swiss bank account has been frozen. The Swiss news magazine "Facts" reported that the account belonged to Juergen Wetzenstein-Ollenschlaeger, who was also the former defense attorney for Stasi chief Erich Mielke. An international arrest warrant was issued for Wetzenstein-Ollenschlaeger in 1992, but he evaded arrest by fleeing abroad. Among other charges, he is alleged to have embezzled 17 million DM from "Commercial Coordination" (Kommerzielle Koordinierung), a GDR state-owned company run by Schalk-Golodkowski.  </field>

<field name="text">The EU Commission has promised a compromise in the dispute over the book pricing policy. Culture Commissioner Reding said in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper that Europe should not destroy proven structures in its harmonization frenzy and that the problem cannot be solved with a crowbar. Federal State Minister of Culture Michael Naumann also expects the new Commissioner for Competition Monti to yield on book pricing policy. The former Commissioner for Competition van Miert wanted to abolish fixed book prices in trade between Germany and Austria. Book dealers and publishers fear that fixed book prices within Germany would then also be discontinued.  </field>

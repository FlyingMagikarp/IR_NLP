<field name="text">Arbitration talks in the contract dispute in the farming industry are in their final round. The mediator, a CDU politician by the name of Heiner Geissler wants to announce a decision by midnight tonight. The union (IG Bauen, Agrar-Umwelt) is demanding a wage increase of 2.9 percent, as well as 100 percent pay in case of illness. However, it is prepared to accept the short-term sacrifice of part of the "thirteenth month's" pay (Christmas bonus). Employers, on the other hand, want a zero increase, the thirteenth month's pay halved, and sick pay cut to 80 percent of full pay, as allowed by law. If there is no settlement, the union is threatening industrial action.  </field>

<field name="text">Bundestag President Suessmuth has called for a speedy agreement on the issue of pension reform. In a newspaper interview, the CDU politician said that a compromise between the Coalition and the SPD was indeed within the realm of the possible. Suessmuth recommended to her own party that it be willing to discuss the reform of the surviving dependents' pension. The same went for making so-called "DM 610 jobs" subject to social security deductions. In return, Suessmuth said, the Social Democrats must accept cuts in order to save money. She also said that people these days do not view parliament and the government very highly; so anyone trying to turn problems into election issues, rather than to solve them, would only increase voters' distrust. Federal Employment Minister Bluem expressed similar sentiments on ARD television. He assured viewers that he would do everything possible to reach an agreement about pensions. SPD leader Scharping, on the other hand, has expressed skepticism about the chances of negotiations with the Coalition. As a prerequisite for such talks, he said that the CDU/CSU and FDP must abandon the idea of lowering pension levels.  </field>

<field name="text">Wellington, New Zealand. Federal Chancellor Kohl has expressed reservations about the chances of a quick reduction in unemployment. No reversal in the current trend is expected in the labour market for 1997. Nevertheless, Kohl told journalists in Wellington, he was sticking to the goal of halving unemployment by the year 2000. The Chancellor, on a trip to Asia, stopped in the New Zealand capital. The dominant theme of his visit is the economy. Following wide-sweeping reforms, many consider New Zealand to be a model for other Western countries, with relatively low unemployment, and a high growth rate. Its national budget is running surplus.  </field>

<field name="text">Bonn.. The post office and the Postbank have signed the agreement over future cooperation, which has been under dispute for several months.

The Postbank will pay more than DM 1.1 billion this year for the privilege. The post office has agreed to leave at least 12,000 of its current 16,000 branches operating until the year 2000, and at least 10,000 after that.

<field name="text">The Regional Court has sentenced a nurse to 5 years' imprisonment in the "fatal injection" trial. The 42-year-old injected a cancer patient with an overdose of sedative 3 years ago. As the judgement was announced, the accused collapsed in tears. One judge, Gottfried Held, said the court would have preferred to acquit her, but the judges could not overlook the facts. The court believed the testimony of one witness who described the accused twice injecting the terminally ill 85-year-old patient with a sedative. It has not been determined whether the sedative was the only cause of death, but the accused has been found guilty of at least attempted murder. The defence will appeal the ruling.  </field>

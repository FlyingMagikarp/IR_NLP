The Chancellor personally attended the meeting today. A group of about 40 dissidents from within the parliamentary group had threatened to vote against the bill if socially just changes were not made. A reintroduction of the capital gains tax was absolutely out of the question for the Chancellor. The issue of de-linking the development of net salaries and pensions should also not be revisited. The vote in the Bundestag is scheduled for October 29.  </field>

<field name="text">President Herzog has expressed his concern that too much importance is given to the considerations of the cost of integration in public debate about the European Union . He said at a meeting with President Horn of Hungary that the key conception of Europe as a community for freedom and peace is often forgotten in such discussion. This cannot be tolerated, he continued; the war in former Yugoslavia has shown what dangers Europe is confronted with daily from the inside.  Before making his statement, Herzog had met with 13 of the minority groups living in Hungary and had praised the policies of the Hungarian government regarding these ethnic minorities, calling them exemplary. The adoption of these policies had greatly improved the country's chances of quickly being accepted as a member of NATO and the European Union, Herzog said, after talks with ethnic Germans living in Hungary and other national minorities in Budapest. The biggest obstacles in this regard had been removed by the adoption of the National Minorities Law and the signing of treaties with Romania and Slovakia, Herzog continued, and he placed emphasis on the fact that he had gained the impression through these meetings that all of those concerned were determined to contribute to the process of reconciliation. Kerner, the chairman of the National Autonomous Administration of German Hungarians (which number over 200,000), gave the assurance that they considered themselves to be loyal citizens of Hungary. There is some degree of autonomous administration in 160 municipalities with populations of ethnic Germans.  Yesterday, in a speech in the Hungarian Parliament in Budapest, President Herzog stressed the fact that Hungary would be one of the first countries in Eastern Europe to gain entry to NATO and the European Union and said that Germany supports its membership of the two organisations unconditionally.  </field>

<field name="text">Despite all pleas against the idea, the Federal Government will not be shaken from its intention to transport six CASTOR containers of nuclear waste to the intermediate storage facility in Gorleben by rail. A meeting held in Luechow between the Environment Minister, Merkel, and representatives from citizens' action groups failed to bring any compromise. Merkel said that she could not cancel the imminent transportation of atomic waste to the intermediate storage facility in Gorleben, but she said that she does take the citizens' worries seriously. Local councils had called on Federal Government in Bonn and State Government in Hanover to abandon the transportation.  After the meeting, Merkel was pelted with eggs, fruit and baking powder by a group of demonstrators. Around 400 people had gathered to demonstrate (in front of the town hall in Luechow) during the meeting and there were some small incidents involving the demonstrators and police. A spokesperson for those opposing atomic power said that Merkel had come too late, as talks just before a transportation of nuclear waste were rarely of any use. According to Glogowski, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony (SPD), the protest movement against Gorleben is increasingly being infiltrated by Autonomen (left-wing/anarchist autonomous groups), but he said that he did not think that the whole protest movement should be considered violent.  The cost of policing the planned transportation of nuclear waste will be higher than had been expected. According to Glogowski, the DM 66 million which was provided for up till now is not enough as the increasing resistance to the transportations has pushed up the cost. Glogowski maintained that the Lower Saxony Police Force was prepared for the coming transportation and could ensure its safety; around 30,000 police officers will be used to ensure the safe transport of nuclear waste to Gorleben. It has been reported that the six CASTOR containers will be connected to a train in Wahlheim on Friday ready for the transportation; according to unconfirmed reports, the transportation will begin at the weekend.  During a news programme of the ARD television channel yesterday, Environment Minister Merkel emphasised the fact that it was necessary to store atomic waste in Germany permanently. It was not acceptable to have all such waste processed and deposited outside of the country said Merkel (CDU). In reaction to the recent attacks on railway lines, she called on the opponents of nuclear power to refrain from turning to violence.  </field>

<field name="text">According to representatives of the energy industry, there is no alternative to the contentious transportation of nuclear waste.  Varnung (sp?), the president of the board of directors of the Rhine-Westphalian Energy Company, said that burnt out nuclear elements could only be stored at the nuclear power plants for a limited period, and thus the transportation of atomic waste to the intermediate storage facility in Gorleben cannot be avoided, nor is it possible to consider delaying the present transportation as this has already been put off for two years. Varnung said that the energy company has not been asked to delay the transportation by any political party.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federal Government has been considering whether the recent breakthrough in the cloning of mammals will make it necessary to bring about a change the law. Schmidt-Jortzig, the federal Minister for Justice, pointed out that the Protection of Embryos Law of 1990 already forbids the cloning of humans, but if it should prove necessary, the law would be changed to fit the new situation. Seehofer, the Federal Minister for Health announced that he would be striving to bring about a European-wide ban on human cloning. The president of the Organisation of German Farmers, Heeremann, called on politicians, scientists and others to formulate guidelines for the use of genetic technology in the raising of animals. British scientists announced at the weekend that they had succeeded in cloning a mammal (a sheep called "Dolly") for the first time.  </field>

<field name="text">The partners in the ruling coalition have said that they do not intend to alter the basic points of the tax reform any further. Solms, the leader of the FDP parliamentary party, said today in Bonn that the discussion with the SPD on the subject could not lead to any and every change that the SPD desired; thus individual details such as the tax reductions for business cannot be dealt with in isolation. Doss, a member of the Bundestag for the CDU, called on the SPD to abandon its "ideological immobility" and to make the way free for reductions in taxation; at the same time, he rejected the SPD's criticism of the plans to tax supplements for night and weekend work.  </field>

<field name="text">Schaeuble, the leader of the parliamentary party of the CDU in the Bundestag, has made an offer of talks to SPD on the pension reform. In an interview with the newspaper "Die Woche" Schaeuble said that he also wanted talks with the SPD, the biggest opposition party, about the future of social security. In connection with this, Schaeuble referred to a comment from Chancellor Kohl that a consensus should be achieved on the difficult discussions about pensions; the pension reform of 1990 was achieved in collaboration with the SPD. According to Schaeuble, the most important point as far as the CDU is concerned is to reach a common position of its own on the pension reform; this should happen by Easter. Schaeuble said that he thought that there is a good chance that unity can be achieved in the present talks about the tax reform, as, after all, neither side could afford to think purely in terms of party tactics; such an action would not be received well by the voting public.  </field>

He said at a celebration for the 150th anniversary of the Ministry for Education in Bavaria that more time spent in education and receiving pensions and a shorter time spent actually employed can not add up. Kohl warned that the arts should not be forgotten in all the talk of reforming the tax and pension systems; Germany must continue to develop as a centre for culture and knowledge.

<field name="text">Schulte, The President of the DGB (German federation of trade unions) has called for an agreement on a cut in working hours; he said in a newspaper interview that he still believes that the number of unemployed could be cut by half by the year 2000. A considerable change in the trend of the employment market is a precondition for this, according to Schulte, and the DGB will be fighting for this at an employment summit meeting with employers and politicians in April. In the short term, 860,000 new jobs could be created through a reduction in overtime and through the raising of the rate at which national insurance payments must be made for part-time work by 5.2 per cent.  </field>

<field name="text">Zoeller, a member of the Bundestag for the CSU, believes that an agreement can be reached next Tuesday on the third stage of the health insurance reform, thanks to the fact that the FDP has given up some of its points of disagreement. Solms, the leader of the parliamentary party of the FDP, had said that his party believed that the present situation could remain, whereby the employer and employee both pay half of the cost, but the contributions must be stabilised at the lowest level. Zoeller said this morning on the radio station "Deutschlandfunk" that the suggestion was only one possibility for the health insurance companies and their committees, where employees are represented, to consider. There is already an equalisation of the burden, as a patient must pay a supplement of up to 30 per cent. Zoeller stressed that the most important point of the reforms was to bring savings, which could be up to DM 70 billion.  </field>

For the first time, the company's turnover has exceeded DM 30 billion; passenger travel has increased but goods transport has decreased, and at the same time, the company has reduced its workforce by 24,000, but this did not involve compulsory redundancies, Duerr stressed.

<field name="text">Health warnings against the dangers of smoking are to remain on cigarette packets; this decision of the Federal Constitutional Court quashed a petition by five cigarette manufacturers. The obligation to print such a warning is compatible with the German constitution according to the judges, as one of the legitimate tasks of the state is to make known dangers to the health of citizens. In its ruling, the court drew attention to the fact that more people die from smoking than from automobile accidents, suicide, murder, alcohol, illegal drugs and AIDS put together.  </field>

The accused, who belongs to the extreme-right-wing scene has admitted to shooting at the bookseller, who works in the PDS building in the Marzahn district. As a motive for the attack, the 24-year old said that he hated the PDS, of which the bookseller was a member. The  legal authorities have issued a further arrest warrant.  The man had been arrested after he had shot one police officer and severely wounded another with a shotgun at a vehicle spot-check on the motorway from Hamburg to Berlin. Forensic investigations proved that the same weapon had been used in both cases.  </field>

Gauweiler, the leader of the CSU in Munich, reinforced his accusations against Reemtsma, the founder of the Institute in Hamburg which had conceived of the exhibition. Reemtsma has, according to Gauweiler, made common cause with the left-wing/anarchist squatter scene around the Hafenstrasse in Hamburg and he should thus consider his own understanding of totalitarianism. Hoderlein, the general secretary of the SPD in Bavaria, said that Gauweiler himself should be investigated by the federal agency for internal security. Also concerning Gauweiler's remarks, Stoiber said that he would have an awful lot to do if he had to comment on everything that a member of his party said.  </field></doc></add>

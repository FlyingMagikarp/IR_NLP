<field name="text">According to an assessment by the German Industrial Association (BDI), the current economic upswing in Germany is no cause for euphoria. In its report on the economy, published today in Cologne, the BDI states that the upswing has so far been one-sided because it is carried by foreign demand while domestic demand lacks a lasting momentum. The BDI called this split economic trend unsatisfactory and said the upswing would not have the power to bring about a turn toward more jobs.  </field>

<field name="text">Finance minister Waigel expressed his opinion that the debate on the planned tax reform should be separated from the question of a VAT hike. Prior to a CSU board meeting in Munich, Waigel said the VAT constituted the remaining quantity in the financing of the comprehensive tax reform, not the initial quantity. He rejected demands from within the CDU/CSU to use a higher VAT partly to relieve pressure on social security budgets, saying the financing of payments unrelated to insurance had nothing to do with the tax reform. The CDU board is meeting in Bonn to discuss the tax reform. Wolfgang Schaeuble, head of the CDU parliamentary group, intends to inform the board about the state of the negotiations. Earlier, a coalition meeting at Chancellor Kohl's office had already discussed the topic. Waigel announced that the results would be presented to the public on Thursday. According to Waigel's ideas, the VAT rate would be raised to 16 % during the course of the reform. He confirmed that his concept intends to lower the maximum tax rate from currently 53 to 39 percent.  </field>

<field name="text">According to its German chairman Vielhaus, the work of the German-Czech Historians' Commission has been crucial for the coming about of the declaration of reconciliation. Speaking on Deutschlandfunk radio, Vielhaus said that the committee had not been consulted by politicians but that the document's wording was mostly identical with the commission's suggestions. Vielhaus emphasized that the declaration could only state that future political relations between both countries should no longer be disturbed by the burdens of the past. In the historical sense, the books could not be closed, and the debate would also continue in public.  The declaration of reconciliation will be signed in Prague tomorrow by the Czech head of government, Klaus, and Chancellor Kohl. Foreign minister Kinkel will also be present.  </field>

<field name="text">Accompanied by protests, the Grundig board of directors today began to discuss the future of the corporation in Fuerth. Several hundred employees met in front of the administration building to protest the job cuts. Altercations ensued when several employees tried to enter the building where the board of directors was meeting at the time. The company's problems aggravated after the Philips corporation withdrew from it. One of the first results of the discussions is the resignation of CEO Peter van der Vaal (sp?). He is accused of being partly responsible for the company's decline. The meeting lasted two-and-a-half hours longer than expected, but when the board members faced the press, they radiated optimism. Christian Schwarz-Schilling, chairman of the board, reproached Philips; until the end of last year, the corporation had run Grundig via a control contract. An outside consultant will now develop plans for setting a new course.  </field>

<field name="text">According to foreign minister Klaus Kinkel, the intended stationing of air defense missiles in the Greek section of Cyprus would put the country's entry into the European Union at risk. Outside the meeting of the EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Kinkel said that the Union could not cope with countries bringing additional problems into the EU from the outside. Kinkel added that the decision on the purchase of the Russian missiles did not help the solution of the Cyprus question. The Turkish government had announced that it would erect its own navy and airforce bases on the island in reaction to the Greek Cypriots' action.  </field>

<field name="text">As the two-day CDU party congress in Hanover wrapped up, Chancellor Helmut Kohl urged the about 1000 members to show unanimity. The party had to go with its well-tried fighting spirit into the upcoming arguments. Kohl called on the delegates to convey the party congress decisions on taxation and education politics to the citizens. Earlier, the main motion by the executive regarding the tax reform was passed with only one opposing vote. The motion stipulates that the lowest income tax rate should be reduced to under 20 per cent and the highest rate to about 35 per cent. Finance Minister Theo Waigel and head of CDU/CSU faction Wolfgang Schaeuble called upon the delegates to find the courage for unpopular decisions in view of the increasing globalisation. The two politicians accused the Social-Democrats of preventing important savings by their blockade policy in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament. Education Minister Juergen Ruettgers re-iterated the government's aim to offer each youth a job training position in future. The congress passed a motion to favour companies that provide job training by awarding contracts or subsidies. The CDU disapproves a fee for companies that do not provide job training.  </field>

<field name="text">The Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called for a fundamental reform of the welfare system. BDI president Hans-Olaf Henkel said in Duesseldorf plans of Health Minister Norbert Bluem were too cautious and short-falling. Henkel suggested to replace the current welfare system by basic welfare and the possibility for additional individual provisions. At the same time Henkel called for a joint fight against unemployment. Everyone had to do their part to create another 2 million jobs until the turn of the millennium.  </field>

<field name="text">Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel thinks chances are good to broaden political and economic ties with the People's Republic of China. After talks with China's President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng Kinkel said today at noon in Beijing the perspectives for the German economy, e.g. in infrastructure and environment, were very favourable. He said he had also addressed human rights violations. In spite of continuing differences in opinion the resentments between Germany and China have been left behind according to both sides. Industry representatives accompanying the German Foreign Minister were also content with the results of their talks in China.  </field>

<field name="text">Public utilities must continue buying power generated from renewable resources and pay certain minimum prices. This was at the core of a ruling the Federal Court in Karlsruhe handed down this afternoon. The court's industrial senate found the respective regulation in the power resource law was constitutional. This means that the owner of two small hydro plants in the Black Forest is entitled to a retroactive payment of the price difference. The federal judges ruled that the legislative was entitled to oblige the monopoly utilities to buy power from certain producers. Public utility companies had a special responsibility to consider the protection of resources, climate, and environment for energy production.  </field>

<field name="text">After almost three years the proceedings about embezzlement at the DG-Bank have ended today. The main defendant Friedrich Steil was accused of having used the bond money of clients for private deals. Former co-workers of Steil have also been accused. Due to the risky business with millions of German marks the DG-Bank had come into serious trouble. The court found Steil guilty of fraudulent conversion in 28 cases and sentenced him to five and half years jail. The three co-defendants received suspended sentences. Steil's deputy received 24 months, two managing clerks each 18 months. They were found guilty of criminal enrichment of DM40 million by illegal private transactions. The proceedings originally set out to investigate the so-called French Deals between 1987 and 1989. The four bank managers and one bonds dealer had engaged in spot transactions at a nominal value of between DM6bn and DM8bn. Their trading partners were 25 French banks. The five accused had allegedly guaranteed the banks to buy back the papers at fixed conditions, although at costs of DG-Bank. When the time came to buy back the papers the rates had dropped dramatically. DG-Bank suffered losses of DM800 million. The top bank tripped and could only be saved with a lot of effort. The French Deals complex had been suspended at short notice because, as the judge explained repeatedly in his verdict, one of the expert witnesses was biased and to clear up the crime was in extreme disproportion to the required effort.  </field>

<field name="text">The Council of German Districts predicts increases of water and sewage fees by 10 percent if the Federal Fiscal Court rules that municipal waste disposal is subject to value-added tax. The council's president-elect, Mr. Landsberg, said in an interview with the daily Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung in individual cases increases of up to 20 percent were possible. Landsberg pointed out that although the ruling would apply to waste disposal in the first place, sewage disposal could not be handled differently for fiscal purposes.  </field>

<field name="text">After a bad start this year the German retail sector now hopes for small gains. The president of the Federal Federation of German Retailers, Mr. Franzen, said averaged over the whole year the sector would be ever so slightly in the black. He is hoping for good Christmas business and counts on longer business hours starting November. A poll by the federation showed that about 75 percent of the retailers want to take advantage of the new shopping hour law and keep their shops open longer. Not all businesses, however, will open their shops for the maximum allowed time. Franzen expects that in the long run only one third of the businesses will be able to cope with the maximum shop opening time. In many places, shop owners have already agreed on core hours, reported Franzen. Yet, Franzen concludes: "The road to longer shopping hours is free. Starting 1 November the clocks in the German retail sector will be changed. This is to be taken literally." The federation president demanded that local public transport companies, too, change the timetables of trams, underground trains, and busses. Here he still feels a wall of resistance. Franzen is also convinced that the police must change their duty schedules. Especially now as night falls earlier public safety must be assured for the clients.  </field>

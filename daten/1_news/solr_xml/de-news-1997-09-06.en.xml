<field name="text">The whole world has lauded Mother Teresa as an outstanding personality and as a role model.  The 87 year old nun died of heart failure Friday evening in Calcutta.  In 1950 Mother Teresa had founded the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, which, among other activities, ran schools, orphanages and the famous house for the dying.  In 1970 she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor and the sick.  At his summer residence, Gandolfo Castle, upon learning of the death of the nun, Pope John Paul II called her a woman who distinguished our century.  A Vatican spokesperson explained that the Pope had received the news about the death of the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize with deep pain and great emotion.  For the head of the Catholic Church, Mother Teresa had constituted shiny proof for the transformation of love for God into love for one's neighbor and into love for those abandoned by society.  US-President Clinton characterized her as an incredible personality who gave comfort to the suffering, the poor and the dying and served as an inspiration and a challenge for humankind.  President of the German Parliament Suessmuth spoke of Mother Teresa as a woman of living Christian faith in an unpeaceful world.  The nun, she continued, gave people of the most varied origins  an example of a life of taking responsibility for one's fellow human beings.  Next Wednesday, the angel of the poor, a name not only given to Mother Teresa in India, is to be buried on the grounds of her Order in Calcutta.  </field>

<field name="text">Parliamentary Business Manager of the CDU/CSU factions Hoerster has appealed to the Social Democrats to stop blocking the planned tax reform.  Mr. Hoerster told DEUTSCHLANDRADIO BERLIN on Saturday morning that he was somewhat doubtful whether the SPD really wanted to bring about a net reduction of the tax burden of the people. The reason for his doubts is that the Social Democrats have not succeeded to date in offering alternative proposals.  The upper house of Parliament, which represents a majority of SPD-governed states, rejected the tax proposals of the Coalition on Friday.  The federal government and the states still want to try again to find a compromise, probably as early as next week.  </field>

<field name="text"> Apparently, there is the beginning of some movement in the frozen diplomatic relations between Iran and the European Union.  Irna, the official news agency, reported that an ambassador of the EU had met in Teheran with a representative of the Foreign Ministry.  No details of the meeting were given.  Almost all EU- countries recalled their ambassadors from Teheran in April because the Iranian government had requested that the German ambassador leave.  The reason for this action was the so-called  Mykonosverdict by which the Berlin Supreme Court had charged the Iranian leadership with terrorism.  </field>

<field name="text"> The decision of the IOC to give the 2004 summer games to Athens was greeted with enthusiasm in the capital of Greece.  Many Athenians are celebrating their selection with motorcades, horn honking concerts and firecrackers.  In Rome and Stockholm, the most promising competitors, tens of thousands of people were disappointed by the decision.  Immediately after the announcement, the initiative circle of the Rhine-Ruhr area announced that it would now give up the idea of applying to host the 2008 games.  The reason: Because a European host has been selected for 2004, their application for the year 2008 would no longer stand a chance.  </field>
